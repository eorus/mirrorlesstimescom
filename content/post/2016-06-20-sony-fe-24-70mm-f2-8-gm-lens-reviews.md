### Reviews Roundup

<a title="Sony FE 24-70mm f/2.8 GM Samples" href="http://www.dpreview.com/products/sony/lenses/sony_fe_24-70_2p8_gm/sample-photos" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">DPReview</a> published their real world samples for the new GM-series full frame lens. More Sony FE 24-70mm f/2.8 GM lens reviews can be found at [Tony Northrup][1], <a href="http://www.thephoblographer.com/2016/05/21/review-sony-24-70mm-f2-8-g-master-sony-e-mount/" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow">The Phoblographer</a>, <a href="https://www.camerastuffreview.com/sony-lens-review/review-sony-fe-24-70mm-f-2-8g" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow">Camerastuffreview</a>, <a href="http://www.imaging-resource.com/news/2016/03/08/sony-g-master-lens-impressions-24-70mm-f-2.8-and-85mm-f-1.4-gm-lenses-look" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow">Imaging Resource</a> and <a href="http://www.dcfever.com/news/readnews.php?id=16484&page=2" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow">DCFever</a> websites.

From The Phoblographer conclusion :

> In all rights, this is a fantastic lens. It delivers wonderful image quality, performs well, has a fast autofocus, and will make lots of professional photographers very happy. For the photographers that love zoom lenses, this is another reason to move to the Sony E mount system if you haven’t already.

From <a href="http://www.photographyblog.com/reviews/sony_fe_24_70mm_f2_8_gm_review/" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow">The PhotographyBlog</a> conclusion :

> Image quality is excellent. Chromatic aberrations are very well controlled, bokeh is impressive thanks to the fast f/2.8 aperture and 9-blade circular aperture, and the Nano AR Coating coatings successfully prevent contrast loss attributable to flare. The only real optical issues are some mild corner shading and slight barrel distortion at the 24mm wide-angle focal length, and a drop-off in sharpness at 35mm compared to the other main focal lengths.

From [AdmiringLight][2] verdict :

> The bottom line is that this lens is exceptional. I’ve never used a standard lens that is this sharp, and the sharpness is outstanding throughout the entire range and at all apertures and all focus distances.  It’s truly remarkable.  Throw in good (but not great) bokeh, outstanding color and contrast and very low CA and you’ve got a standard lens that can truly take the place of a bag full of primes.
