Olympus has patented a new **24mm f/1.4** lens in Japan designed for full frame mirrorless cameras.

Actually the patent application consists of two Olympus lenses with 24mm and 50mm focal lengths and f/1.4 maximum aperture. The interesting part is that both lenses are developed for mirrorless cameras with full-frame image sensors.

Currently there are no rumors for a **Oly full frame mirrorless** camera model but this is the third patent filed in Japan. This could refer to a future product like an Olympus full-frame mirrorless camera but on the other hand we might not see these products in mass production.

Previously we have seen the **28mm f/2 and 35mm f/1.4** mirrorless lenses, this 24mm f/1.4 prime lens is also designed for full frame image sensored cameras. Sure all these prime lens patents might refer to a premium fixed lens full-frame compact camera like the Sony RX1R series.<!--more-->

Anyway we hope these patents became real and we may see the new Olympus full frame mirrorless camera at Photokina 2016 in September this year.

The first unit in the patent application is the Olympus 24mm f/1.4 lens. Its internal design consists of 15 elements divided into 12 groups. The configuration seems to include five aspherical elements along with a couple of Extra-Low Dispersion elements as well as a couple of fluorite elements.

The second unit described in the same patent is the Olympus 50mm f/1.4 lens. The maximum aperture of this prime model is the same as the one found in the wide-angle version.  According to the <a title="Olympus patents lenses for full-frame cameras" href="http://egami.blog.so-net.ne.jp/2016-03-25" target="_blank">patent source</a>, the lens has 14 elements in four groups. Three elements are aspherical, two of them are fluorite, while one of them is an Extra-Low Dispersion.
