The announcement date of the Olympus PEN E-PL9 is unknown at the moment. We think the mirrorless camera might be unveiled in early 2018. This might be at the Consumer Electronics Show CES 2018 which opens its doors in January or the CP+ 2018 event in February.

No detailed specifications or release date information leaked on the web. We do belive that PEN-series cameras have provided great value for the money and the **Olympus E-PL9** will continue this trend. This means it would be a stylish and selfie-friendly camera.
