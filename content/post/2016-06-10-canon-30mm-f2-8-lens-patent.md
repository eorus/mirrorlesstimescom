Canon has patented for an optical formula that appears for a **30mm F2.8 DO lens** designed for company’s future full-frame mirrorless camera.

From the <a href="http://egami.blog.so-net.ne.jp/2016-06-10" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">patent application</a> we can see that Canon is working on a new prime optic with a maximum aperture of f/2.8. If becomes available, it will be aimed at Canon EOS-M mirrorless cameras with full-frame image sensors. We can also say the upcoming 30mm F2.8 DO will be a new prime model with DO featuring diffractive optics.

Canon lenses which feature the diffractive optical (DO) are smaller and lighter compared to the same focal length lenses but the price becomes generally higher when the lenses have optical formual for DO.<!--more-->

The rumors about a professional Canon mirrorless camera have been circulating on the web for many years. It is already mentioned that a [Canon full frame mirrorless camera][1] is in the works. The camera is expected to become official at Photokina 2016 event with two other EOS series mirrorless models. There are also so many patents filed for a possible full-frame MILC.

Here are the details of the patent translated by machine.
