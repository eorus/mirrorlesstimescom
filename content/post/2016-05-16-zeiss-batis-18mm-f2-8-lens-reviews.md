First **Zeiss Batis 18mm F2.8 lens reviews** now available on the web with new tests, sample images and videos.

The [new Batis-series lens 18mm][1] is a super wide optic designed for A7-series full-frame cameras. The lens delivers a 35mm focal length equivalent of approximately 27mm when attached to Sony E-mount mirrorless shooters with APS-c sized image sensors.

The design of the lens is based on Distagon and comprises 11 elements in 10 groups, and four of those elements are aspheric on both sides. Maximum aperture of the Zeiss Batis 18mm lens stands at f/2.8, where the minimum one is f/22.

After the launch of the wide-angle optic several Zeiss Batis 18mm F2.8 lens reviews appeared online. <!--more-->

### Reviews and Tests

> _The Batis 2.8/18 demonstrates an impressive level of optical performance that can be achieved in a compact and lightweight mirrorless full-frame system. Although at the time of this writing there are no lens correction profiles available in Lightroom / Adobe Camera Raw for this super wide angle Batis, I see no demand for it as the results were almost free from distortion and vignetting. Only at open aperture you may see a need to correct some minimal CA at extreme contrast edges. Resolution, contrast and color richness are excellent even when you shoot against direct sun light. The autofocus works fast and reliable, it may be helpful especially at open aperture when playing with depth of field in the close-up range. This lens is simply amazing!_

> It was an amazingly sharp, well built, weather sealed, fast and accurate auto focus which was a dream to use. 18mm is one of my favorite focal lengths. It’s super wide with minimal distortion. In fact when I was using Canon I picked up a Zeiss 18mm 3.5 lens because my 16-35 was not very sharp at all. I quickly replaced my 16-35 with an 18mm and a 28mm. I felt much better carrying 2 small light fast primes than risking soft shots wide open in late light for clients. With 5 axis image stabilizer and the 42 mega pixel files it’s rivaling medium format for a fraction of the cost. Thank Zeiss for constant pushing to make superior lenses that do exactly what I need.

> Thanks to its large field of vision with extremely low distortion, it’s perfect for architectural photography. The ZEISS Batis 2.8/18 fulfilled a long-held wish he had had for a wide angle with excellent imaging performance.

> The Zeiss Batis 18mm f/2.8 Distagon is the finest 18mm lens ever to be produced for full frame cameras.

> All in all, I was exceptionally impressed with the performance of this lens and the image quality it produced. All of the photos I’m sharing today were taken with this Batis 2.8/18 and the Sony a7R II back in January.

ZEISS Batis lenses are also equipped with dust and weather seals, allowing them to be used in even the harshest weather conditions. All ZEISS Batis lenses support all the operating modes and functions of the current range of E-mount cameras.

The first two Batis models are the 25mm f/2 and the 85mm f/1.8 as these optics deliver a very high image quality and provides the same dust and weather seals. The brand new wide-angle prime optic features an OLED screen, just like its siblings.
