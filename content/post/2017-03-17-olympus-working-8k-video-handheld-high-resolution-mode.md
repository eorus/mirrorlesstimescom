Olympus is working on 8K video and handheld high-resolution mode for future Micro Four Thirds cameras.

In an interview with <a title="" href="https://www.focus-numerique.com/news/parlons-stabilisation-avec-olympus-19661.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">French publication Focus Numerique</a> (<a title="" href="https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&tl=en&js=y&prev=_t&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.focus-numerique.com%2Fnews%2Fparlons-stabilisation-avec-olympus-19661.html&edit-text=" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">google translation here</a>), Olympus executives revealed that image sensor with 8K video support Handheld High Resolution mode will be coming to future Micro Four Thirds cameras.

General Manager of Olympus Product Planning, Mr. Akira Watanabe, said:

> _“We can assure you that there is no problem in developing sensors at 33 million pixels for filming in 8K. We started the 4/3″ saga with a sensor at 5 Mpx In 2003. Now the same sensor is at 20 Mpx with a much higher image quality especially for the management of electronic noise.”_

And Olympus will be able to offer a handheld high-resolution image mode in the future.

> _“I think this is a feature we can offer in the future”_

In addition, Olympus mentioned a Bluetooth-based app (similar to Nikon’s SnapBridge) could be implemented in future camera models.

> _“The Nikon Bluetooth technology is actually very interesting…this is a direction we will study.”_

It’s hard to predict for now how close Olympus will bring these new features and technologies to the market. But it is absolutely exciting for brand users and fans that these tech is in the works.
