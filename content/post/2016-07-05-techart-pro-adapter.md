### Techart unveils the World’s First Autofocus Adapter for Manual Focus Lens, the Techart PRO AF Leica M lens adapter for Sony E mount cameras

Techart PRO has adopted the z-shift technology where the Leica M bayonet is able to extend and retract. The distance between the lens and the camera sensor is hereby changed in order to reach the focus. The mechanism is quite similar to Contax AX system where the flange distance is changed for autofocusing. It has electronic contacts to communicate with the Sony A7II and Sony A7RII and uses its PDAF system to measure focus. The built-in motor will then drive the bayonet forward by a maximum of 4.5mm and reach the focus point for shooting.

The adaptor weighs only 133g and is able to drive a lens system as heavy as 700g. Apart from pairing up with the Leica M lenses, users can also further adapt lenses with longer flange distance (e.g. Leica R, CY, PK, MD, etc) with add-on adapters and enjoy the autofocusing experience with other manual lenses. The adapter supports both AF-S and AF-C modes and it can also serve as a close focusing adapter which can reduce the minimal focusing distance of the lenses. A complimentary mobile app will be available for users to save 10 sets of lens data to the adapter and perform firmware upgrade via bluetooth.
