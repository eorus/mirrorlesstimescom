Olympus is rumored to announce two new prime lenses with a fast aperture of f/1.2. The two new **Olympus f/1.2 lenses** are slated for late 2016.

One of these optics will be the [Olympus 25mm f/1.2][1] prime model. This lens is on the rumor mill from the beginning of 2016. It will be the first lens in a series of fast primes and join the company’s PRO-series.

Olympus PRO series lenses for mirrorless cameras are freezeproof, splashproof, and dustproof. It’s a big possibility that we might see the Olympus 25mm f/1.2 PRO lens at <a title="photokina 2014" href="https://www.mirrorlesstimes.com/tags/photokina-2016/" target="_blank">Photokina 2016</a>.<!--more-->

## Two New Olympus F/1.2 Prime Lenses Rumored for Late 2016

Olympus is working on several ultra-bright prime lenses for Micro Four Thirds system cameras. There have been <a href="http://www.dailycameranews.com/2015/09/olympus-e-m1-mark-ii-and-f1-aperture-prime-lens-rumors/" target="_blank">rumors</a> about it before.

The first lens would be the **M.Zuiko 25mm f/1.2 PRO**. It is said that this optics is developed to work with the PEN-F camera. The autofocus speed will be 30% faster when used with the PEN-F than with the OM-D E-M1.

The previously rumored Olympus bright prime lenses will offer 12mm, 25mm, and 50mm focal lengths. Here is a recap of the possible Olympus lenses for the second half of 2016.

### MFT lenses rumored so far:

  * Olympus 25mm f/1.2 PRO lens
  * Another f/1.2 prime lens with PRO designation
  * [Olympus 30mm f/3.5 macro lens][2]
  * [Olympus 12-100mm f/4.0 lens][3]

Users are expecting a lot of new products. They have to wait for Photokina show this year. It will open its doors in September for almost two weeks. The Olympus prime lenses would be a good addition to their lineup. As [Micro Four Thirds][4] users demand more all-in-one prime models. So featuring a maximum aperture of f/1.2 would also make this as a fast long standard lens. That sure would be more useful for MFT users.

These fast aperture optics to be unveiled at Photokina 2016 with the Olympus E-M1 Mark II camera. Stay tuned with Mirrorless Times for more information!
