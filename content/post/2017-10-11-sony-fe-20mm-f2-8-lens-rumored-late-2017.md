Sony is on the verge to announce a new **FE 20mm f/2.8 lens** designed for its full-frame E-mount system.

This would be another budget-friendly optic just like the <a href="http://amzn.to/2xYOrBu" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">50mm f/1.8 FE</a> and <a href="http://amzn.to/2yGQYxC" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">28mm f/2.0 FE</a>. Official announcement of the product expected by the end of 2017.

The upcoming FE 20mm f/2.8 lens would be a relatively compact model like <a href="http://amzn.to/2gbhOXI" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">A-mount version</a>. It is expected to be in a **slim and lightweight package.** More details after the break!

## Sony FE 20mm f/2.8 lens to be announced soon

The Tokyo-based company already has the <a href="http://amzn.to/2yXurOb" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Sony E 20mm f/2.8</a> for its mirrorless system cameras. This will be the FE (full-frame E mount) version of the current lens.

This means you will be able to use this lens with Sony full-frame E-mount cameras like the A7 and [A9][2], or with APS-C sensor cameras, such as the [A6500][3]. Cameras with crop factor gets an effective 30mm equivalent focal length.

The wide-angle is more suitable for most types of photography, including landscape, portrait, and street. We expect the lens to be lightweight as the E-mount version. That model weighs only 69 grams / 2.4 ounces.

When it comes to the price, the FE 20mm f/2.8 lens is expected to be priced around **$399**. Stay tuned with us for more information.
