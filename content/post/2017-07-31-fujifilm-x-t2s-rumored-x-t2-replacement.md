### Rumored X-T2s specs

  * Higher EVF and LCD resolution.
  * Electronic IBIS
  * Touch-screen AF from the GFX
  * Larger buffer
  * Better video performance

As you know, Fuji is a great company that develops its existing products with firmware updates instead of releasing new ones. So we might see some the expected features added to the current X-T2 one by one. Later on they might release the second version called Fujifilm X-T2s with the upgraded FW addons.

Nevertheless, everything is based speculation, which means that you should not jump to conclusions for now. To wrap up the rumor we can say the **Fujifilm X-T2 successor** is in the works and to be called as **X-T2S.**
