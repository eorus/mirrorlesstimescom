Here is the EYE AF comparison test for [Nikon full frame mirrorless cameras][1]. Dpreview compared the [Nikon Z7][2] side-by-side with the [Sony a7R III][3] for Eye AF.

Mirrorless enthusiasts are familiar with Eye AF which is found on Sony mirrorless cameras, including the <a href="https://amzn.to/2SK17UI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a7 III</a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/2SHNVjg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a7R III</a> against which the Z6 and Z7 compete. The features incorporated in new firmware being developed for the Z6 and Z7 full-frame mirrorless <a href="http://www.guidetocamera.com/products/cameras/nikon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nikon cameras</a>,

  * <strong style="font-size: 1rem;">Eye AF </strong><strong style="font-size: 1rem;">–</strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;"> Under development is an Eye AF function, which will automatically detect the subject’s eyes to make attaining critical focus on the eyes easier. It will allow users to capture photos in which focus has been clearly acquired on the subject’s eye, which is useful for portrait, event and street photography scenarios.</span>

Nikon’s upcoming firmware is planned that will add Eye-detection AF, CFexpress support and Raw video over HDMI to the Z6 and Z7, with AF and AE improvements also coming in May. Check more details [here][4].<!--more-->



> Both cameras do a good job of recognizing the subject’s eye and sticking with it, even when she covers her face for a period of time. They’re similarly fast to find the eye again, afterward. This recognition (and how quickly it re-acquires the eye) is key to the performance of eye-detect AF, as we’re already pretty confident about the Z7’s ability to focus when requested.
