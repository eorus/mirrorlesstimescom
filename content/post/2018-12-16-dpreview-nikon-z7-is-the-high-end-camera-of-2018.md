Conclusions from dpreview:

> The Nikon Z7 is an extremely well-rounded digital camera and suitable for a wide range of photographic and video needs. It packs outstanding image quality and very good 4K video in a lightweight, well-built package with in-body image stabilization. Autofocus is slightly less reliable than the competition and the buffer can be limiting for fast action, but overall, the Z7 is a pleasure to shoot with.
> 
> Good for ; Hybrid stills and video shooters, photographers looking for a versatile tool for a wide range of subjects in a compact package.
> 
> > Not so good for ; Those needing a faster burst rate, greater buffer depth or the absolute best focus tracking.
