From  <a title="" href="https://www.dxomark.com/Reviews/Sony-Carl-Zeiss-Plannar-T-FE-50mm-f-1.4-ZA-lens-review" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow">DxOMark</a> conclusion :

> Adding a very fast f/1.4 maximum aperture option to the Sony/Zeiss 50mm lineup will be welcomed by Sony a7 shooters looking for a high-performance, general-use, low-light lens.
> 
> Costing $1498, it’s a pretty expensive option. At 108mm in length and weighing 778g, it’s a fairly bulky bit of glass for use on the smaller Sony mirrorless cameras, too. If you’re after the best results from your a7 series hybrid at 50mm. However, the Zeiss FE 50mm f/1.4 is outstanding, delivering some of the best low-light performance and sharpness possible in this category.
