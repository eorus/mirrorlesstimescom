Lensbaby announces the launch of the Composer Pro II with Sweet 80 Optic.

The Composer Pro II with Sweet 80 Optic is an 80mm f/2.8 tilting lens designed for portrait photographers or anyone looking for selective focus at longer focal lengths. By bending the depth of field around photographers’ subjects, the Sweet 80 achieves Lensbaby’s classic “sweet spot” effect of tack sharp focus on the subject while the surrounding area fills with compelling streaky bokeh.

“A Lensbaby lens is like a paint brush with a very distinctive stroke,” said Lensbaby Chief Creative Officer and Co-Founder Craig Strong.

“As you get to know these perfectly imperfect brushes for your photographic canvas you’ll be surprised at the previously impossible images you’ll create.”

### Composer Pro II with Sweet 80 Optic Specs:

  * 80mm focal length
  * f/2.8-16
  * 46mm filter
  * Internal 12-blade aperture
  * Up to 15 degrees of tilt
  * Focuses from 22&#8243; from the front element to infinity
  * Dimensions: 2.5 x 2.5 x 2.5 inches
  * Weight: 8.9 ounces
  * Mounts: Nikon F, Canon EF, Sony E, Sony Alpha A, Fuji X, Micro 4/3, Pentax K, Samsung NX

The Composer series of lenses are tilting lenses that allow the photographer to move a spot or slice of focus anywhere in the frame. This lens series features Lensbaby’s Optic Swap System. Simply purchase one lens for your camera system, then, when you’re ready to shake things up, use a different optic to change the effect and focal length of your lens.

The Composer Pro II with Sweet 80 Optic will be available for purchase in early October 2017 for $379.95. For those who already own an Optic Swap compatible Lensbaby lens body, the Sweet 80 Optic will be available separately for $199.95. To further extend the Optic Swap System offering, Lensbaby will also launch the Creative Bokeh Optic. Harkening back to Lensbaby&#8217;s iconic vintage roots, this optic features a single, uncoated 50mm glass element, an internal 12-blade aperture and magnetic drop-in apertures in a variety of shapes. These drop-in disks create obvious patterns and texture in the out of focus areas of the image. An Optic Swap compatible lens body is required to use this optic and it will be available for purchase in October 2017 for $99.95.
