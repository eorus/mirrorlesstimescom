Sony has introduced the **E PZ 18-110mm F4 G OSS** lens for Super 35mm and APS-C format cameras.

The E-mount power zoom lens provides a focal length starts at 18mm wide angle and extends to 110mm at the telephoto end. It has a 6.1x high zoom ratio, even with inner focus. The optic maintains a constant F4 maximum aperture throughout its zoom range. Designed for video shooters the optic uses the company’s Smooth Motion Optics (SMO) design to prevent focus breathing, focus shifts and axial image shifts while zooming.

The **E PZ 18-110mm F4 G OSS** also includes a dust- and moisture-resistant design, built-in SteadyShot and quiet operation.<!--more-->
