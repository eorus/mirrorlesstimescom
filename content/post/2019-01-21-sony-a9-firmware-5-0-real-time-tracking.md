<a href="https://www.dailycameranews.com/2019/01/sony-major-firmware-for-a7-iii-a7r-iii-and-a9-will-improve-af/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sony A9 firmware update 5.0</a> will be available from March. Patrick Murphy-Racey published a Youtube video showing the tracking feature. By the way the new tracking feature is already inside the <a href="https://www.mirrorlesstimes.com/tags/sony-a6400/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sony A6400</a> bodies that will start shipping in February of 2019.

From the video, we can see that the Sony A9 (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06ZY7GNKN/?tag=mtimes-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external" data-amzn-asin="B06ZY7GNKN">Amazon</a>/<a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1333228-REG/sony_ilce_9_b_alpha_a9_mirrorless_digital.html/BI/20175/KBID/14249/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">B&H Photo</a>/<a href="http://adorama.evyy.net/c/63923/51926/1036?u=https://www.adorama.com/isoa9.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Adorama</a>) has an impressive read time tracking with this firmware 5.0. Check it out. <!--more-->



This was a test of how the [A9][1] was able to use the new hybrid tracking feature by combining the use of distance, movement, Face Detection, Eye AF, color, and pattern. By using all of these together the AI (artificial intelligence) residing in the camera&#8217;s programing is able to see the human body type, pattern of clothing & hair, movement, employ Eye AF and Face Detection all at the same time. This creates a very easy to use and even scary combination of auto-focus. I call it the &#8220;Spider-Monkey&#8221; AF setting. You kind of have to see it to believe it so I&#8217;m posting this video to show what it&#8217;s like in real time. There are two clips. Each clip is shown once in real time, and then the same clip is repeated at 45% speed so you can see what the camera is accomplishing. When you see the large rectangle flash, it is me shooting stills at 20 frames per second. Needless to say, I cannot wait to be able to employ the Spider Monkey AF system on most of my shoots once I get hold fo the firmware update again in March!
