The <a href="https://www.dailycameranews.com/2018/10/new-firmware-updates-released-for-fujifilm-x-t2-x-h1-x-t1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently released firmware update 5.50 for Fujifilm X-T1</a> has a compatibility bug with Fuji’s compact zoom <a href="https://amzn.to/2JpqXcM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XC15-45</a>. Fujifilm promises to fix it soon. Check out all details below.

**Regarding the Malfunction of the FUJIFILM X-T1 Firmware ver.5.50**  
<!--more-->

To all loyal Fujifilm X Series customers and photographers,

It has been brought to our attention that there is an issue with the recently released <a href="https://amzn.to/2JshXnd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X-T1</a> ver.5.50 firmware update. We have therefore removed the update from the website until we are confident that the issue has been completely fixed.

We deeply apologize for any inconvenience and disappointment this has caused.

_<Malfunction>_  
The firmware is not compatible with XC15-45mmF3.5-5.6 OIS PZ. Zoom and manual focus functions don’t work with the firmware.

_<Note>_  
There is no issue to the compatibility with XF200mmF2 R LM WR added by the firmware ver.5.50.  
And this has nothing to do with all the lenses of FUJINON XF and XC series lenses other than the XC15-45mmF3.5-5.6 OIS PZ.

We have identified the cause and plan to release the upgraded firmware to address the malfunction as soon as we can.
