Fujifilm has released an **updated X-Mount lens roadmap for 2016**.

Three new lenses have been added to the lens roadmap. These are the **XF 23mm f/2 R WR**, **XF 50mm f/2 R WR** and the **XF 80mm f/2.8 R LM OIS WR**.

We can say that the previously listed the [XF 120mm F2.8 R Macro][1] model has been replaced with a new model. It is the **XF 80mmF2.8 R LM OIS WR** to meet the market demand for compact and lightweight lenses.

The expanded 25-lens lineup covers extensive angles of view from ultra-wide angle to ultra-telephoto. Fuji will now expand the macro category to further enhance photographic versatility.<!--more-->
