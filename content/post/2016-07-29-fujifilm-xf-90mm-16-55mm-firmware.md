Fujifilm **XF 90mm f/2 and XF 16-55mm f/2.8** lens firmware updates has been released to public.

The new version upgrade resolves the issue which may result in a failure if the upgrade is conducted with a camera whose firmware is the previous version.

The XF 90mm f/2 consists of 11 elements in 8 groups. The construction includes three ED (extra low-dispersion) elements, which reduces chromatic aberrations.
