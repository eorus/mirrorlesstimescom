Here are the latest [Sony E 18-135mm f/3.5-5.6 OSS][1] lens reviews published on the web.

The _E 18-135mm f/3.5-5.6 OSS_ from **Sony** is a versatile 27-202.5mm equivalent zoom for APS-C-sensor mirrorless bodies with the lightweight of just 325 g in weight. The lens features 2 ED and 1 aspherical elements, a minimum focus distance of 45cm. The Optical SteadyShot image stabilization helps to minimize the appearance of camera shake for sharper imagery when shooting handheld with slower shutter speeds.

The price of the new standart zoom lens is <a href="http://amzn.to/2CvahfJ" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>$598 in US</strong></a>. Check out the **Sony E 18-135mm f/3.5-5.6 OSS lens reviews** by Cameralabs and Digitalphotopro.<!--more-->

## First Sony E 18-135mm f/3.5-5.6 OSS Lens Reviews

<span id="more-1966"></span>From Cameralabs verdict:

> The Sony E 18-135mm f3.5-5.6 OSS is a compact, lightweight and versatile general-purpose zoom for its cropped-frame mirrorless bodies, this Sony’s version is noticeably smaller and lighter than those from Canon, Nikon and Fujifilm, while also boasting smoother and quieter focusing. After a string of disappointing general-purpose zooms for their cropped-frame bodies, the E 18-135mm thankfully delivers fairly crisp results across the frame and throughout the range. I still think there’s room for a higher-end model sacrificing reach for weather-sealing and a brighter focal ratio, perhaps a 16-50mm f2.8-4, but for the money the E 18-135mm is a no-brainer for all A6000, A5000 and NEX owners looking for a compact general-purpose zoom or an upgrade from the 16-50mm. It’s an easy lens to recommend and one I hope becomes Sony’s future kit zoom for APSC bodies.

From Digitalphotopro conclusion :

> It’s amazing to me the quality of lenses these days. Each new generation of lens, even those at a consumer-level price point, provides excellent optical quality and performance. I’m not about to ditch my small prime lenses when I’m shooting travel photography, but the E 18-135mm F3.5-5.6 OSS makes for a trustworthy lens, and a nice, affordable backup lens as well.
