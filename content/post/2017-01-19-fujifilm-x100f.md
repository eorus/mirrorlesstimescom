Fujifilm has announced the **X100F**, a new addition to the X Series range of premium compact cameras.

The X100F features a **24.3MP X-Trans III APS-C sensor** and X-Processor Pro image processor borrowed from the [X-T2][1]. It has the further evolution of the renowned Advanced Hybrid Viewfinder, which can switch between optical and electronic viewfinders.

With the new **X100F,** the AF system has been further developed, which is a major hassle for X100-series cameras. The number of autofocus points has been increased from **49 to 91 and fastest AF acquisition time improved to 0.08 seconds**. The premium-compact now provides a **startup time of 0.5 sec** and 0.2 sec shutter release.

The Fujifilm X100F will be available February 16th in black or silver for <a href="http://amzn.to/2iElS6o" target="_blank"><strong>$1299/£1249</strong></a>.<!--more-->

Fujifilm has announced the fourth in its series of X100 rangefinder-style cameras: the X100F. The X100F features an updated sensor, revamped autofocus system, larger battery and tweaked ergonomics.

The most obvious difference is the X100F&#8217;s new front control dial, which brings the total dial-count to three.

The LCD screen is the same, but controls are now arranged on the right of the display, with an AF selection joystick added at upper-right. This is the same control in the X-Pro2 and X-T2.  Another one is the addition of an integrated ISO dial to the shutter speed dial on the X100F&#8217;s top-plate. This matches the same dial on the X-Pro2.
