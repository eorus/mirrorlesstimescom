Nikon has registered the “N1514” name at an agency in Indonesia. This means that the high-end **Nikon mirrorless camera** is on the horizon and coming in the near future.

<a title="" href="https://sertifikasi.postel.go.id/index.php?0601=&key=2&cari=nikon" rel="external nofollow" data-wpel-target="_blank">Indonesian communications agency</a> is usually the place where devices with wireless connectivity must be registered before becoming available on the market. This is why we can assume that this camera will come packed with WiFi.

This is the first time the Nikon mirrorless camera was mentioned, but it would not be a surprise if it becomes official around the Photokina 2016 event.<!--more-->

## New Nikon mirrorless camera name appears on Indonesian agency’s website

There were several rumors floating around about a large-sensor mirrorless shooter from Nikon. The rumor mill has repeatedly claimed that a new high-end Nikon camera will be introduced sometime around the Photokina 2016. The camera is also said to be in the similar size as the <a href="http://amzn.to/28Ks8BT" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow">OM-D E-M1</a> shooter from Olympus.

It could be a F-mount model but at the moment no confirmed rumors floating around. Anyway stay tuned with us for more information as we are approaching the Photokina.
