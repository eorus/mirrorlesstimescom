More information for the **Canon full frame mirrorless camera** has been leaked online.

According to latest <a title="Canon Rumors" href="http://www.dailycameranews.com/tag/canon-rumors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumors</a>, the upcoming MILC will not use a new mount, instead it will make good use of EF mount lenses.

A **full-frame mirrorless camera** from  Canon is rumored since at least two years. There will not be a 4th mount added to the Canon ILC lineup. <!--more-->

## Canon full frame mirrorless camera is in development

The Japan-based company is actually working on three new mirrorless cameras. The two of them is said to feature a full frame image sensor while the other one is the APS-C-sized units. The [EOS M5][2] is Canon’s latest mirrorless camera, but it is not the pro-grade one that the company’s fans are looking for. The rumors about a professional Canon full frame mirrorless camera have been circulating on the web for many years. So we might see the high-end model soon.

It is also said that there maybe a fixed lens full frame mirrorless camera. We can think about a <a href="http://amzn.to/2eiTO3T" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Sony RX1R</a> like model. The camera might be unveiled first before we see an ILC full frame mirrorless. Because such a camera was in development and apparently that is still ongoing.

Even the announcement date is unknown at the moment. We can expect any sort of full frame mirrorless announcement until the end of 2017 at the earliest. Stay tuned for more information.
