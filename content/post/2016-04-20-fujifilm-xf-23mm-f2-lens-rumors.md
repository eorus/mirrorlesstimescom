Fujifilm is rumored to be working on a **XF 23mm f/2** wide-angle prime lens for its X-mount mirrorless cameras.

Trusted <a href="http://bit.ly/1YGzisG" target="_blank">sources</a> are reporting that the company has listened to its fans and that the Fujifilm XF 23mm f/2 lens is in the works. The wide-angle optic is said to become available this year at the Photokina 2016 event in September.

If it becomes a reality, then the lens will be compatible with all X-mount cameras, including the flagship X-Pro2 model. It will have a maximum aperture of f/2 and provide a full-frame focal length equivalent of 35mm.

    This is the XF 35mm f/2 R WR compact lens

</div>

Fuji currently has the fast XF 56mm f/1.2 R lens. It is an optically exceptional lens with a ridiculously wide aperture that gives you creamy background blur to enhance any portrait. It’s a perfect choice for shooting indoors, portrait and at night. The company also has the fast XF 35mm F1.4 R and XF 23mm F1.4 R prime lenses.

The XF 35mm f/2 R WR with a full-frame equivalent of approximately 53mm lens is expected to have a good alternative such as an optic with focal length equivalent of 35mm.

The company is rumored to announce a new XF 33mm f/1.0 and XF 200mm f/2 lenses. Highly anticipated [Fujifilm X200][1] digital compact camera rumored for early 2017.

We have to underline that all lenses are on Fuji’s unofficial roadmap which means that the company may change their plans for future products.

As usual, take these details with a grain of salt and stay with Mirrorless Times for more information.
