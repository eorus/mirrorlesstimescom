Sony A9 sensor score is 92, it is better than [Canon EOS-1D X][2] and <a href="http://amzn.to/2pbIsVS" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Nikon D5</a>.

From <a href="https://www.dxomark.com/Reviews/Sony-a9-sensor-review-Game-changer" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">DxOmark </a>conclusion:

> The Sony A9 sensor ranks as one of the best we’ve tested at base ISO, with consistently good scores for dynamic range and color depth, and exceptional results for noise. At those crucial mid to high ISO sensitivities for action photographers, image quality is also excellent and on par with flagship Nikon and Canon sports DSLRs.
> 
> For the very best image quality, the [A7R II][6] offers better results for color, as well as almost twice the sensor resolution, but it isn’t a sports camera and can’t compete for performance against the a9, so they’re intended for different markets.
> 
> With a big body-only price tag of [$4500][7], the Sony a9 is squarely in the pro category, going head-to-head with the top-end Canon and Nikon DSLRs. With many pros already heavily invested in lenses and accessories for those systems, it’s going to be a tricky (not to mention expensive) to switch, but the Sony a9 has both the performance capabilities and image quality that make it a seriously tempting proposition.
