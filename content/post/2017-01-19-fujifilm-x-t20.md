Fuji has unveiled the X-T20 mirrorless camera with new 24MP sensor and 4K video recording.

The stylish, lightweight MILC is a lower-end model to the enthusiast [X-T2][1]. The X-T20 borrows the **24.3 megapixel sensor** and its **advanced autofocus system** from the upper model.

The brand new image processor delivers high speed AF, fast start-up and 4K video with Film Simulation modes. The camera can also shoot **UHD 4K video at up to 30 fps** but lacks the weather sealing.

The Fujifilm X-T20 will be available in Black and Silver from 23rd February 2017 for <a href="http://amzn.to/2jBKRGs" target="_blank">$900/£799 body only</a>, $1000/£899 in a kit with the XC 16-50mm lens, or $1200/£1099 with the XF 18-55mm lens.<!--more-->
