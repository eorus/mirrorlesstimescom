Sony is rumored to announce the Mark III version of its A7-series full-frame E-mount camera this Fall. The **Alpha A7III specs** to feature the same **24-megapixel sensor and AF system** from the high-end [Sony A9][1] camera.

Sony is planning to release more E-mount bodies by the end of this year. One of them is allegedly the **Sony A7 Mark III**, which will take the place of the A7II.

According to recent rumors, the A7III specs will have the same sensor and autofocus system of the Alpha A9 but unlike the flagship shooter the A7III will not have a higher burst rate. More details after the break!<!--more-->

## Sony A7III Specs to Feature 24MP Sensor and AF system of A9

The <a href="http://amzn.to/2f7ZfSy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sony A7II</a> is the first full frame mirrorless camera to employ a 5-axis sensor-shift image stabilization system. It comes with a 24-megapixel sensor, maximum ISO of 25,600, tilting display on the back.
