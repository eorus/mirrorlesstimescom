Sony already registered a new camera with the code name “**WW361847″.** This camera is expected to be the upcoming Sony A9 or A7III full-frame E-mount models. More details after the break!<!--more-->

Sony A9 is a long-runored device and if becomes true it will wit on top of the camera line-up. Sources reports that it is under development with **2 models.** One of them is expected to feature a [70MP sensor][2]. The other one will probably be the super **high-performance AF, continuous shooting and ISO sensitivity**.

It is easy to expect that it will feature **in-body 5-axis image stabilization** technology. [Sony A7II][3] was the world’s first **full frame mirrorless** camera with IBIS. So a higher-end product will definitely have it.

According to the latest rumors, the first model in the series will feature a low-resolution sensor. As mentioned above this would be the high-perofrmance AF camera with 20fps continuous shooting.

This is the latest **Sony A9 rumors** which will be the next flagship model. The sales price should be around **$6000**.
