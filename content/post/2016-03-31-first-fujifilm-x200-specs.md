First **Fujifilm X200** specs list mentioned within the rumor mill as Fuji expected to unveil the X200 in the second half of 2016 probably at Photokina 2016 event in September.

Back in 2014, the rumor mill were in talks of a Fujifilm X200 digital camera several times to replace the X100S. At Photokina 2014 Fuji decided to show the X100S successor with X100T model.

So this year a new X100-series model is a big probability. Several rumors for the Fujfilm X200 have circulated on the web in 2015 and now the premium compact shooter might arrive at **Photokina 2016**.<!--more-->

## More Fujifilm X200 specs and launch details show up on the web

The latest Fujifilm X200 specs list is stating that the shooter will employ a 24-megapixel APS-C sensor, also found in the X-Pro2.

The Fuji X200 is expected to have several improvements like the improved version of viewfinder with a quicker refresh rate for the electronic viewfinder. If true the big change will be the lens of the camera. The Fujifilm X200 will feature a new bright 28mm equivalent lens which is expected to be the one on the new Fuji X70 camera. It will actually be a 18.5mm f/2.8 lens (28mm Equiv.).

Furthermore, the compact shooter will employ some kind of a digital converter, allowing photographers to set the focal length to equivalents such as 35mm and 50mm.

Alongside the Fujifilm X200 digital compact camera, the company is rumored to announce a new XF 33mm f/1.0 and XF 200mm f/2 prime lens for **Photokina 2016**. We have to underline that both lenses are on Fuji’s unofficial roadmap which means that the company may change their plans for future products.
