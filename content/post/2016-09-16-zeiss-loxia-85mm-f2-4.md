## Zeiss announces the Loxia 85mm f/2.4 Sonnar FE lens

A new telephoto prime lens hits the ZEISS Loxia lineup. The Loxia 85mm f/2.4 joins the manual focus lens family for Sony α7 series cameras. This is the fourth ZEISS Loxia optic produced for Sony mirrorless full-frame cameras with E mount. The first three are the Loxia 2.8/21, Loxia 2/35 and Loxia 2/50.

Specially designed for mirrorless full-frame cameras with E mount, the compact ZEISS Loxia lenses are the ideal choice for travel and street photographers who value light and compact camera equipment.

### Also ideally suited for filming

Videographers also don’t come off badly with the new Loxia. Again the well-known de-click function is on board. This allows for mechanically deactivating the click stops on the aperture ring. This is a condition for silent and infinite adjustments of the aperture. As a result, the ZEISS Loxia 2.4/85 is also an attractive lens for video cameras that have an E mount, such as the Sony PXW-FS7 and PXW-FS5.

The overall package comprises a robust metal barrel, the filter diameter of M52 (which is identical across all focal lengths) and protection against penetration of dust and spray onto the lens mount. In addition, the external diameter, which is uniform across all ZEISS Loxia lenses, simplifies film shoots.
