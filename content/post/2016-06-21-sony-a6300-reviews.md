### Reviews

CameraLabs published their full review and said Sony’s sensor technology is racing ahead of the competition. According to them the Sony a6300 is a dream for sports and action photography. Dpreview also posted their A6300 first impression review.

From <a title="" href="http://www.cameralabs.com/reviews/Sony_Alpha_A6300/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">CameraLabs</a> :

> As for sports and action shooters, the earlier A6000 may have been no slouch, but I’m genuinely excited by the new capabilities of the A6300. In my brief time with the camera it felt quicker and more confident at tracking subjects, and I’d be happy to sacrifice 3fps for the new live update in the viewfinder. If it performs as hoped in my tests I’ll definitely be upgrading.

From <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/sony-a6300" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dpreview</a> review :

> It’s pretty clear that Sony set out to create a future-proof camera in the a6300, one whose specs will likely look impressive, even two years down the road. The camera has a lot of fire power, both in the AF and video departments, and initial impressions indicate that everything works as it should. Which is to say, the a6300 is a really impressive little camera.It’s certainly not going to turn any heads with it looks, but it should give you everything you need to instead turn heads with your images. Which for most, is a much more worthwhile goal.
