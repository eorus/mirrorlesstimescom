**Sony A9 full-frame E-mount camera** is rumored to be announced in early 2017 instead of late 2016 due the sensor production shortage.

The rumor mill is once again in talks of a camera called Sony Alpha A9. The next generation high-end model will be placed above the A7-series.

The sensor will be brand new but it&#8217;s not clear what will be the megapixel count. As you might guess it will be in high-resolution and rich in features.<!--more-->

## Sony A9 full-frame E-mount camera to be announced in early 2017

It will be a great news if we meet the Sony A9 in the first quarter of 2017. If so the official announcement should be at CES 2017 or  CP+ 2017 events.

The upcoming flagship E-mount camera will have a **bigger grip** in dimensions. The design is expected much more like a DSLR size. So it will be bigger than the current A7-series cameras but not huge as current DSLRs.

On the other hand considering the camera mainly targeted to professional action and sports photographers. It will be more comfortable to hold and use for action and sports shooting.

One question is clear folks that Sony A9 will feature **in-body 5-axis image stabilization** technology. [Sony A7II][2] was the world’s first full frame mirrorless camera with IBIS. So a higher-end product will definitely have it.

When we look at the previous gossips, there were mentions about a 72MP sensor resolution. Yes we know Sony always tries for the best and the first when it comes to new tech. But sadly it is not confirmed yet.

Sony A9 will be the next flagship model. It will be capable of capturing **unlimited RAW photos** in continuous shooting mode. This means it can capture unlimited and won’t pause for buffering. It will also have **dual card slots**. Both slots will support only **XQD cards**.

This is all for **Sony A9 full-frame E-mount camera** details. It is expected to arrive in early 2017. Stay tuned with us and we’ll pass more information when it is available.
