First **Panasonic GX85 reviews** now available on the web with new tests, sample images and videos.

The [Lumix DMC-GX85][1] is an all-around Micro Four Thirds camera designed for photographers and videographers. We can say it is a stripped down version of the GX8 model.

The mirrorless camera features a 16MP Live MOS sensor, which lacks an optical low-pass filter for increased sharpness. The GX85 is capable of shooting continuously at up to 10 fps with single-shot autofocus, or 6 fps with continuous autofocus, as well as up to 40 fps when using an electronic shutter function.<!--more-->

Several full in-depth Panasonic GX85 reviews can be found below with samples and hands-on videos.

From <a title="" href="http://photobyrichard.com/reviewbyrichard/panasonic-lumix-gx85-review/" target="_blank" rel="external">Richard Wong</a> review:

> [..] GX85’s smaller and lighter body, lower price (GX85’s retail price should be around NZD$250 cheaper than the GX8 when it hits the market), and with the better image stabiliser and built-in flash, it is also a more versatile camera for everyday use. Personally, I want the GX8 if I’m buying a micro four thirds camera for myself tomorrow because I just really love that camera especially it’s fantastic electronic viewfinder. But at the same time I feel the GX85 is indeed the better camera for most people.

> The GX85 may not have the best of everything, but its a really versatile camera that you can easily carry with you all the time.

When considering the video features of the GX85, it records UHD 4K (3840 x 2160) video with either 30p or 24p frames rates at 100 Mbps in the MP4 format. Full HD 1080p/60 is also supported, in both MP4 and AVCHD formats, as well as HD and SD resolutions.
