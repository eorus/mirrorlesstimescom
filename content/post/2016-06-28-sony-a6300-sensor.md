From <a href="http://www.dxomark.com/Reviews/Sony-A6300-sensor-review-Sony-s-best-APS-C-sensor-to-date" target="_blank">DxOMark</a> conclusion:

> Sony’s A6000 sensor was class-leading when it was introduced, and while the sensor in the A6300 is in a similar position, it’s not alone. Nikon’s sensors in the D7200 and the more cost-conscious D5500 perform similarly. In terms of specifications, the A6300 looks attractive. For some metrics, its sensor performance, dynamic range in particular. It can match the 24-Mpix full-frame A7 II. However, the price seems somewhat at odds with rival offerings. Even taking into account the premium for its 4K video and AF capabilities, it’s much harder for it to compete at this level. But as far as sensor performance goes, it doesn’t get a lot better.

The A6300 model feaures a 24-megapixel APS-c image sensor. It has an incredible “4D” autofocus system with a whopping 425 phase-detection autofocus points. The sensor provides maximum ISO of 51200 and 4K video capture up to 100 Mbps. The A6300 from Sony has a price tag of <a href="http://amzn.to/28KJ0Lz" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$998 at Amazon</a> store.

**Sony A6300 sensor** results shows that the company is improving much in this lineup. Hope this post helps our readers who considers to buy this model.
