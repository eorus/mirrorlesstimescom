The mirrorless shooter achieved an impressive score of **85% **and earned Silver Award from the <a href="https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/sony-alpha-a6500" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external">Dpreview</a> experts. See their conclusion below:

> _For the money, you get a light-weight, weather-sealed body with excellent still image quality. Excellent 4K video quality, a degree of in-body stabilization and the ability to photograph high speed action with ease. And if you take the time to fully customize the camera, you can really make it sing. Simply put, as an all-arounder, its pretty hard to beat what the a6500 offers, but as an engaging artistic tool. The a6500 may still leave some wanting more._

> Speed and usability are the two main focuses of the A6500. The camera&#8217;s new processing capabilities and touchscreen functionality are a testament to that. Add in all of the features it shares with the A6300 and you have a recipe for an excellent all-around APS-C mirrorless camera. The proof is in the pudding, however, so we will need to put the A6500 through its paces.
