<a href="https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/sony-a7r-mark-iii-review" target="_blank" rel="follow external noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external">Dpreview</a> also published their full Sony A7rIII review: “Easily Sony’s best camera yet, and one of the best cameras we’ve ever tested”. The high-resolution shooter received Gold Award at dpreview, with overall score at **90%**. It is currently the second best camera in the world, just after <a href="http://amzn.to/2hKuzJs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nikon D500</a>.

**The conclusion from the review :**

> _The sheer capability of the Sony a7R III is hard to overstate. With the sports-oriented a9, Sony was aiming for outright speed; the a7R III has inherited much of that, but offers far more resolution and dynamic range. Like the Nikon D850, the a7R III is a camera that you can shoot just about anything with, from landscapes to fast action._
> 
> _There is a vast number of small improvements and refinements in the a7R III. From the ergonomics to the better organized menus, this is the most usable and engaging a7-series camera yet. The on-sensor autofocus system needs some work in terms of subject tracking, but in other autofocus modes, the a7R III makes it dead easy to get the most out of the 42.4MP of resolution it offers. Never before has shooting such high resolution files been so fun, or so painless._
> 
> _The a7R III still can’t quite match the feeling of immediacy that comes with using a high-end DSLR; the card write speeds can get in your way, and the learning curve for new users can be steep. But the fact remains that the a7R III is capable of gorgeous still images and video, and has the feel of an impressively polished product. In our opinion, this is easily Sony’s best camera yet, and one of the best cameras we’ve ever tested. It’s the most well-rounded mirrorless camera on the market today, and for that, it earns our highest award._
