## Sony medium format mirrorless camera to be announced at Photokina 2016

A new _Sony medium format mirrorless camera_ to be announced at Photokina 2016. The MILC is expected to come with a bunch of new lenses for this new format.

It appears that Hasselblad is to “blame” for this project. We know Hasselblad announced the new 100-megapixel sensor H6D-100c. The new Hasselblad H6D-100c doesn’t have 4K feature and the Phocus image processing software couldn’t process the raw files. So, Sony was so disappointed by the H6D-100c camera that it decided to make its own medium format camera, as <a href="http://bit.ly/1q3cyY7" rel="external nofollow">sources</a> say.

As a result, we might get to see a Sony medium format mirrorless camera as early as Photokina 2016. It would become the first product of its kind, as stated above. The camera will be good for sports photographers that it will offer unlimited RAW shooting. It will store photos on dual XQD memory cards, according to some reliable sources.

Sony is said to be working on a new flagship A9 mirrorless camera which is also rumored for the big event. It is unlikely that the company will announce both the flagship Alpha A9 full-frame model and the new 100-megapixel sensor medium format mirrorless camera. Maybe, there is a possibility that the new Sony medium format mirrorless camera is the Sony A9 who knows.

More details are expected to show up online when we get closer to the announcement sometime in June or July.
