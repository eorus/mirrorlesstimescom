According to <a href="http://www.dailycameranews.com/2016/04/first-sony-a9-specs/" target="_blank">leaksters</a>, the upcoming flagship MILC shooter will have a **bigger grip** in dimensions. It will have a DSLR alike design and size. As expected it will also be bigger than the current A7-series.

The A9 full-frame mirrorless camera from Sony will be capable of capturing **unlimited RAW photos** in continuous shooting mode. This means it can capture unlimited and won’t pause for buffering. Quite amazing feature! Even the camera won&#8217;t support for CFast version, body will include **dual card slots**. Both slots will support only **XQD cards**.

Sony A9 will support the new FE-mount lenses and the main competitors would be the **Nikon D5** and **Canon EOS 1D-X Mark II** full-frame digital SLR cameras.

The next generation full-frame MILC from Sony will be a giant leap. The rumor mill is claiming that the A9 will become the company’s flagship model. Currently there is no details about the official announcement date. Sony A7-series are selling great so we can expect the company won’t announce this amazing mirrorless camera in the near future.

Anyway stay tuned with &#8220;**Mirrorless Times**&#8221; and we’ll give more information about this exciting camera when it is available. Just like with all rumors, take this one with a grain of salt.
