From <a href="http://www.dxomark.com/Reviews/Sony-FE-24-70mm-F2.8-GM-review-Best-zoom-in-the-range" target="_blank">DxOMark</a> conclusion:

> Given the emphasis on the high-grade components and construction to match the maker’s high-resolution sensors,. We had high hopes for the Sony FE 24-70mm F2.8 GM, and we weren’t disappointed. It is the best-performing zoom in the maker’s range. It can easily hold its own against the new AF-S Nikkor 24-70mm F2.8E ED VR. However, for edge-to-edge to sharpness, the Sony isn’t quite in the same league as the Canon EF 24-70mm F2.8L USM II. We still have to add the Sony A7RII to propose a fair comparison with the 50 Mpix Canon EOS 5DS R. Nevertheless, the Sony does have certain strengths, better transmission and lower lateral chromatic aberration than many high-grade primes. It’s still a competitive and tempting addition to the range.

The FE 24-70mm f/2.8 GM is currently priced for $1,699.95 at <a href="http://amzn.to/1XcXItL" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amazon</a> store. It features special elements for reducing aberrations and increasing resolution. The coating is dust and moisture resistance, and a compact design. The optic has a 9-bladed aperture, special coatings for reduced reflections. It also comes with a direct drive SSM for fast and quiet focusing.
