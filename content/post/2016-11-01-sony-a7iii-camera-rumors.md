## Sony A7III camera rumored to be unveiled next year

Before we jump into the rumored specs of the **Sony A7III camera** let&#8217;s remember the previous model a bit. The <a href="http://amzn.to/2f7ZfSy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sony A7II</a> is the first full frame mirrorless camera to employ a 5-axis sensor-shift image stabilization system. If a lens with Optical SteadyShot technology is attached to the camera, then the A7II will recognize that and will combine both systems to offer the best stabilization possible.
