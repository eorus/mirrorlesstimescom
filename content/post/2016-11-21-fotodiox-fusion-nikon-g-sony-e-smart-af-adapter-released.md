  * Powered VR image stabilization in compatible lenses.
  * Compatible with all manual vintage Nikon F mount lenses.
  * Infinity focus guaranteed for all Nikon lenses.

### Compatible Cameras

Sony Alpha E-mount Cameras (popular cameras include): Sony a7, a7R, a7S, a7 II, a7R II, a7S II, Sony a3000, a5000, a6000, a3500, a5100, QX1, PXW-FS7, Sony NEX-3, NEX-5, NEX-C3, NEX-5N, NEX-7, NEX-F3, NEX-5R, NEX-6, Sony NEX-VG10, NEX-VG20, NEX-VG30, NEX-VG900, NEX-FS100, NEX-FS700, NEX-EA50

### Auto Focus Speed

The Nikon to Sony E-mount FUSION adapter’s auto-focus functions are designed to work best with newer cameras that have ‘Phase Detection AF’ such as the Sony a7R II and a6500 cameras. The FUSION adapter will work with cameras that use “Contrast Detection AF”. But performance is significantly slower. We don’t recommend this configuration. All other non-focus functions work equally well on all Sony cameras.
