<a href="https://www.ephotozine.com/article/sony-fe-85mm-f-1-4-g-master-review-29472" target="_blank">ePhotozine</a> posted a full in-depth review of the prime optic. They say : &#8220;**The Sony FE 85mm f/1.4 GM gives outstanding performance and beautiful bokeh, a magnificent short telephoto with a bright f/1.4 aperture.**&#8221;

> The Sony FE 85mm f/1.4 G Master lens is a traditionally very high quality choice. It is ideal for many more types of subject than portraits, although with the beautiful bokeh provided portraiture may well be high on the list for users of this lens. A very fine lens, very well made and a joy to use, this is superb in every respect.

> If you chose Sony for your camera of choice, and made the full frame choice or even the A6300 which is a remarkable APS-C camera, you owe it to yourself to check out this 85 1.4 if you are a fan of fast primes or are a wedding pro, portrait pro or just a passionate enthusiast like me. I just can not see this lens disappointing anyone. Just be sure your wallet is loaded as this lens will set you back $1800. Around the same price range as the competitors..this is just what it costs for that step above in quality.

The <a href="http://www.photographyblog.com/reviews/sony_fe_85mm_f1_4_gm_review/" target="_blank">PhotographyBlog</a> conclusion outlines a few notable drawbacks to the Sony FE 85mm f/1.4 GM lens though. &#8220;_The auto-focusing system is pretty loud. Makes it less than ideal for movie shooting or for candid use in very quiet environments. It also slows down and hunts quite a lot in lower-light conditions._&#8221;
