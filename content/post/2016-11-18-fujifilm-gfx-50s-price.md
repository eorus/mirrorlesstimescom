The budget-fridnly MF camera in the market is the Pentax 645z. It costs $7,000 with no lens. This is almost even with the Fujifilm&#8217;s 8k intro price.

If **Fujifilm GFX 50S price** becomes around $8K with lens, we can say the company is right in line. Considering the Hasselblad&#8217;s price $9K with no lens, the medium format Fuji should be the better value.
