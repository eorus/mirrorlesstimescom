Steve Huff published a great review of the <a href="https://www.mirrorlesstimes.com/tags/canon-eos-r/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Canon EOS R</a> camera. The title says it all “_<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>20 Reasons Why I Bought One and 5 Things <a href="https://www.mirrorlesstimes.com/category/canon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Canon</a> Messed Up</strong></span>_&#8220;.

Looking for the Canon EOS R availability? Due to high demand of the Canon’s full frame mirrorless camera, here is the [Canon EOS R in stock tracker][1].

The EOS R (<a class="ext-link" title="" href="https://www.amazon.com/Canon-Cameras-Digital-Camera-3075C002/dp/B07H484HLT/?tag=daicamnew-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener external noreferrer nofollow" data-wpel-link="external" data-amzn-asin="B07H484HLT">Amazon</a>, <a class="ext-link" title="" href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1433710-REG/canon_eos_r_mirrorless_digital.html/BI/20175/KBID/14249/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external noreferrer nofollow" data-wpel-link="external">B&H</a>, <a class="ext-link broken_link" title="" href="https://adorama.evyy.net/c/63923/51926/1036?u=https://www.adorama.com/car.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external noreferrer nofollow">Adorama</a>) features a **30.3MP CMOS sensor** with Dual Pixel AF and an ISO range of 100-40000 (expandable to 50-102400).<!--more-->



From <a class="ext-link" title="" href="http://www.stevehuffphoto.com/2018/10/13/canon-eos-r-is-here-nineteen-things-i-like-five-i-dont/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external nofollow">Steve Huff</a>:

_**Before I go further, I will state 19 things I like about the EOSR so far. **_

A: The swivel “flippy” screen,

B: The new lenses are beautiful in build, feel and weather sealed with QUIET AF motors.

C: The ergonomics for me beat Sony as do the menu system.

D: Battery life is great so far. No complaints.

E: 1080P HD video looks fantastic. No mushiness here.

F: Love the fact that I can get an adapter with a built in ND filter.

G: Touch screen LCD.

H: Super good low light AF (-5 EV with 50 1.2) and decent IQ at high ISO (still testing this)

I: Can use EF-S lenses as well with adapters, auto crops to APS-C in camera.

J: Mic and Headphone inputs

K: The Size is nice. Thinner than a 6DII, much less bulky than any DSLR. Feel GREAT.

L: EVF is 2nd best I have used next to the Leica SL EVF.

M: Dual pixel AF and face tracking is FAST, for video it is rock solid as well.

N: CRAZY customizable. I mean, it’s extensive.

O: Top LCD is nice to check settings on the fly.

P: Feels better than my Sony in the hand and in use.

Q: AF points can go just about anywhere on the screen. No limitations.

R: Q Menu is awesome and touch screen works well in this menu.

S: LOVE the control ring on the new lenses. Can be programmed to suit your needs.

_**Things I would have liked to be different:**_

A: Should have two card slots these days, without question.

B: Should not have a 1.7 Crop for 4K video (Sony doesn’t do this)

C: Touch bar thingamajig is not needed. Could have used that space for something more useful.

D: Shutter sound is kind of clunky.

E: I liked the photo/movie switching better on their DSLR’s.
