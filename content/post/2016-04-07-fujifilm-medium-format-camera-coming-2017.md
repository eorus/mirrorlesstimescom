**Fujifilm medium format camera** is on the rumor mill again. It is expected to be announced in 2017 with **50-megapixel** image sensor.

According to recent gossips, Fuji is developing a medium format camera. It will feature a large 50-megapixel image sensor that will be made by Sony.

The announcement of the Fujifilm medium format camera might be by the end of this year but the release date or availability should be sometime in 2017.<!--more-->

When considering the Photokina 2016 event in September this year, the company might display a prototype of the camera and again release it in 2017.

So it looks like the Pentax 645Z will have a new competitor. Mirrorless cameras are becoming serious altenatives to DSLR cameras thanks to their size/weight advantages. On the other hand if becomes available in the market, Fujifilm will probably have a higher price tag than the Pentax model.

When we look at the previous rumors about Fujifilm, the upcoming medium format model might feature hybrid viewfinder. Still unknown if it will be mirrorless and support interchangeable lens units or not.

On the other hand Sony’s new sensor worth 100-megapixel used in the new Phase One is physically larger than the 50MP sensor. Also it is much closer to the true 6 x 4.5 size. A medium format talk for Fuji will be better include this kind of sensor.

Photokina is the world’s biggest digital imaging show and it will open its doors by the end of September. The company might display a prototype of the Fujifilm medium format camera. Stay tuned for more information!
