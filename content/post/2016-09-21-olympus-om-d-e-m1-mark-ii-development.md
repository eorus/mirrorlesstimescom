[Olympus][1] has announced the development of its newest flagship camera at the Photokina 2016 event. The [OM-D E-M1 Mark II][2] is now official with 4K and 50MP high-res mode.

The new camera will feature a 20.4-megapixel Live MOS [Micro Four Thirds][3] sensor. It has an ISO range of 200-25,600, which can be expanded down to 64 ISO. It does not have an anti-aliasing filter.

The sensor is coupled with a TruePic VIII processor, which is about 3.5x faster than the TruePic VII engine. It delivers up to 18fps with continuous autofocus and up to 60fps with single AF in burst mode.<!--more-->

This is the first Olympus camera that offers 4K video recording. The **E-M1 Mark II** also supports the DCI 4K standard, so it captures movies at 4096 x 2060 pixels at up to 24fps, while the maximum bitrate stands at 237 Mbps.

The built-in electronic viewfinder has a frame rate of 120fps and a lag of only 6ms. Moreover, shutter release lag has been reduced by 30%, while a Pro Capture mode allows users to half-press the shutter button in order to capture up to 14 shots at maximum resolution.

The Olympus E-M1 Mark II features an integrated 5-axis image stabilization technology. It provides 5.5 stops of stabilization. If you pair the camera with a lens that also has an IS system, then the technology will offer up to 6.5 stops of stabilization.
