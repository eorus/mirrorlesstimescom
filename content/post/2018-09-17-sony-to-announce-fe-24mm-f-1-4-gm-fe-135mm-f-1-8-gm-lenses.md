Currently the GM lineup consists of the mid-range <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-FE-24-70mm-2-8-Lens/dp/B01BESQYJW/?tag=daicamnew-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-amzn-asin="B01BESQYJW">FE 24-70mm f/2.8 GM</a> zoom, a near-perfect <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-FE-85mm-1-4-Lens/dp/B01BESR5KO/?tag=daicamnew-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-amzn-asin="B01BESR5KO">FE 85mm f/1.4 GM</a> portrait prime, and a telephoto staple in the form of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-70-200mm-2-8-OSS-Lens/dp/B01IDQEQ34/?tag=daicamnew-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-amzn-asin="B01IDQEQ34">FE 70-200mm f/2.8 GM OSS</a>.<!--more-->
