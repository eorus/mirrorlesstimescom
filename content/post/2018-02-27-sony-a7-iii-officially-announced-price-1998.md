The full frame E-mount camera also has 5-axis 5-stop IBIS, 693 point auto-focus system covering 93% of the image area, Eye auto-focusing mode, a joystick for adjusting the focus point, and class-leading 710 shot battery life.

Sony A7 III will be available from April at a cost of **$1999**, body-only or will be available in a kit with the FE 28-70mm F3.5-5.6 OSS lens. check pre-order links at <a href="https://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/QiTnTtxLJDpTSaGENKRQTJAAAAFh1lvheAEAAAFKARtW-KE/https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/http://amzn.to/2FyRBOq/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=1519704372&linkCode=w61&imprToken=1HT6DX1aOOx-tmLHpialUA&slotNum=0" target="_new" rel="nofollow" data-wpel-link="external" data-amzn-asin="1519704372">Amazon</a> | <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1394217-REG/sony_ilce_7m3_alpha_a7_iii_mirrorless.htmll/BI/20175/KBID/14249" target="_new" rel="nofollow" data-wpel-link="external">B&H Photo Video</a> | <a href="https://adorama.evyy.net/c/63923/51926/1036?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fisoa7m3.html" target="_new" rel="nofollow" data-wpel-link="external">Adorama</a>.<!--more-->

## Sony A7 III Announced with 24MP sensor and 10fps burst : Price $1,998

<img class="aligncenter" title="Sony a7 III Officially Announced, Price $1,998" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.dailycameranews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Sony-A7-III-mirrorless-camera-officially-announced.jpg?resize=768%2C392&ssl=1" alt="Sony a7 III Officially Announced, Price $1,998" width="768" height="392" /> 

The auto-focusing system in the Sony A7 III is the same as the A9 in terms of AF point and coverage &#8211; 693 AF points and 93% coverage. 10fps burst shooting is available with either the silent electronic shutter or the mechanical one, complete with AF/AE tracking, just like on the A7R II.

One key upgrade over the older A7 II is the excellent 710-shot battery life thanks to the NP-FZ100 battery, which is also used in the Sony A9 and A7R III cameras.

The A7 III&#8217;s video recording capabilities will also be key to its success, as it can record 4K movies (3840×2160 pixels) at 25/24fps, utilising a 6K full pixel readout, with 14 stops dynamic range and 4K Hybrid Log Gamma. It can also shoot 1080p footage and slow-motion 120/100fps video.
