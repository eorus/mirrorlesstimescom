Along with the entry-level <a href="https://www.mirrorlesstimes.com/tags/canon-eos-rp/" data-wpel-link="internal">Canon EOS RP</a> full frame mirrorless camera, six new Canon RF lenses are also in development. These RF lenses are expected to be released in 2019.

The most captivating has to be the RF 70-200 F2.8L IS USM. The 70-200 will be stabilized. Canon will be offering two versions of its RF 85mm F1.2L USM: a ‘regular’ model and a ‘DS’ variant. DS stands for Defocus Smoothing, which Canon says ‘offers a combination of beautifully smooth defocused bokeh.

Meanwhile, there are two fast zooms on the way: the RF 15-35mm F2.8L IS USM and the RF 24-70 F2.8L IS USM. Finally a travel zoom lens in the works too – the RF 24-240mm F4-6.3 IS USM.

## **CANON ENSURES THE SUCCESSFUL FUTURE OF ITS RF MOUNT WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF SIX NEW LENSES**

_New Lenses Under Development Cover a Range of Core Focal Lengths_

**MELVILLE, N.Y., February 13, 2019 – **Continuing with the message of “optics at its core,” Canon U.S.A. Inc., a leader in digital imaging solutions, today announced that its parent company, Canon Inc, is developing six new RF-series lenses, further displaying the company’s commitment to the EOS R full-frame mirrorless camera system. Canon’s new RF mount allows for fast, light, and high-performing optics with a large opening diameter and short back focus distance. Each new lens in development will help fulfill the needs of amateur and advanced amateurs to professional photographers and videographers, covering critical focal lengths. In 2019, Canon’s already well-established optical lens heritage will celebrate a production milestone of 140 million EF and RF lenses and the celebration starts with the development announcement of these six lenses [i].

The six new RF lenses under development include:

  * [Canon RF 85mm F1.2 L USM DS][1]
  * <a href="https://www.mirrorlesstimes.com/tags/rf-15-35mm-f-2-8l-is-usm/" rel="tag">RF 15-35mm f/2.8L IS USM</a>
  * <a href="https://www.mirrorlesstimes.com/tags/rf-24-240mm-f-4-6-3-is-usm/" rel="tag">RF 24-240mm f/4-6.3 IS USM</a>
  * <a href="https://www.mirrorlesstimes.com/tags/rf-24-70mm-f-2-8l-is/" rel="tag">RF 24-70mm f/2.8L IS</a>
  * <a href="https://www.mirrorlesstimes.com/tags/rf-70-200mm-f-2-8l-is-usm/" rel="tag">RF 70-200mm f/2.8L IS USM</a>
  * <a href="https://www.mirrorlesstimes.com/tags/rf-85mm-f-1-2l/" rel="tag">RF 85mm f/1.2L</a>

“Optics are the critical piece of the visual puzzle that bend light and capture an image as the artist envisioned,” said Kazuto Ogawa, president and chief operating officer, Canon U.S.A., Inc. “That is why it is so important for us to strengthen our family of RF lenses for the EOS R camera system. With this collection of new lenses, customers will have more of the tools they need, for the images they desire to create.”

All six RF lenses under development are built around Canon’s new RF mount, which features a large 54mm diameter and shorter back focus distance than on current EOS DSLR cameras. In addition, the RF mount enhances communication and power transmission between the lens and camera body, which has helped Canon to achieve the world’s fastest autofocus speed for a full-frame mirrorless camera system[ii].

### The details of the new Canon RF lenses under development are as follows:

The **RF 85mm F1.2 L USM** is a large aperture mid-telephoto prime lens. It offers excellent performance for advanced and professional portrait photographers and is a widely popular focal length and aperture speed combination for users.

The **RF 85mm F1.2 L USM DS**, with Defocus Smoothing lens technology, is a uniquely designed lens that offers a combination of beautifully smooth defocused bokeh. Featuring a super-fast F1.2 aperture, the lens will help produce breathtaking portraits that will surely stand out from the crowd.

The **RF 24-70mm F2.8 L IS USM **is a high-performance, standard zoom lens for professionals and photo enthusiasts alike – ideal for shooting portraits, landscapes, documentaries or weddings.

The **RF 15-35mm F2.8 L IS USM**, offering a wide angle and fast aperture in a single package, is ideal for a variety of shooting applications including architecture, interiors or landscapes.

The **RF 70-200mm F2.8 L IS USM **is a must-have for any professional photographer, especially for those shooting weddings, sports or wildlife. This lens is a great all-around, high-speed, medium telephoto zoom lens and does well to round out any camera bag.

The **RF 24-240mm F4-6.3 IS USM** is the ideal lens for amateurs and advanced amateurs who love to travel, no matter the destination. The versatile, all-purpose lens offers a range of focal lengths for capturing extraordinary shots in a form factor that is both compact and lightweight.
