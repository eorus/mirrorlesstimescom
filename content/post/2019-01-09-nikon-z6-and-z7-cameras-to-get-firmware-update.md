## Nikon Add Eye AF, ProRes RAW Video and CFexpress Support to Z6 and Z7 Cameras

Displays of new features, including Eye AF and support for RAW video output which will be incorporated in new firmware being developed for the full frame mirrorless cameras Nikon Z 7 and Z 6, will take place as part of the Z series exhibition.

The Z series will continue to flexibly respond to changing user needs and offer next-generation imaging experiences that stimulate users&#8217; creative intentions.

### Display of cameras running new firmware

The following new features to be added to firmware that is currently being developed for the Z 7 and Z 6 will be displayed at CES 2019:

### Nikon Z6 and Z7 &#8211; Eye AF

The Eye AF allows for the convenient detection of the subject’s eyes, making focusing easier. It will allow users to capture photos in which focus has been clearly acquired on the subject&#8217;s eye, for situations such as portrait and street photography.

### Nikon Z6 and Z7 &#8211; Support for RAW video output

Nikon is currently developing a feature that works with the ATOMOS Ninja V to output video in RAW format, using the ProRes RAW codec.

### Nikon Z6 and Z7 &#8211; CFexpress

Coming soon to the Z 6 and Z 7 cameras is compatibility with CFexpress, which is compatible with XQD memory cards.
