Fujifilm is rumored to announce a new wide-angle zoom lens which will be named as the **XF 8-16mm f/2.8 WR. **

First rumors has begun to surface at the beginning of 2016. But the company didn&#8217;t unveil the XF 8-16mm f/2.8 in the following period, including Photokina 2016.

The reason behind the delay could be to complete the <a href="http://amzn.to/2kvRYRd" target="_blank">WR series prime trio</a>. As a result Fuji prioritized smaller WR lenses, such as the [XF 35mm F2][1], [XF 23mm F2][2] and the [XF 50mm F2][3]. <!--more-->

## Fujifilm XF 8-16mm F2.8 WR lens is on the horizon

The Fujinon X-mount lens line-up will have new additions in 2017. The first lens should be the XF 80mm F2.8 1:1 Macro model.

It is believed that once the Fujifilm completes the current roadmap, the next X-mount lens will be the **Fujinon XF 8-16mm f/2.8 WR. **

The wide-angle zoom lens will be designed for landscape, architecture, and interior photography. The **maximum aperture will stand at f/2.8**. The optic will provide a full-frame focal length equivalent of about **12-24mm**. From the WR designation, we understand that the product will be **weather-sealed**. So a great in combination with the X-T1 or the [X-T2][5] mirrorless cameras.
