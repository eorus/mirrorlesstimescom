Olympus filed a new patent in Japan. The patent application is for **Olympus 12-35mm f/4.0-5.6 lens** primarily designed for Micro Four Thirds cameras.

The M.Zuiko Digital 12-35mm f/4.0-5.6 is reportedly in development and could be released sometime in the near future.

The optic will cover a pretty useful focal range. Its 35mm focal length equivalent stands at 24-70mm, meaning that it will cover a wide-angle to telephoto range when mounted on Micro Four Thirds shooters.<!--more-->

## Olympus 12-35mm f/4.0-5.6 MFT lens patent

When we look at the details of the lens, we can say that it is collapsible and can be used for both fixed lens and system camera versions.

If it becomes available on the market, then the Olympus 12-35mm f/4.0-5.6 lens will most likely replace the current 12-50mm version. Olympus M.ZUIKO DIGITAL ED 12-50mm F3.5-6.3 EZ Lens can be purchased for about <a href="http://amzn.to/2tg7uC9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$500 at Amazon</a>.

We expect a similar price for the lens in the patent application. The Olympus 12-35mm f/4.0-5.6 MFT lens would serve as an alternative for those who cannot afford the <a href="http://amzn.to/2tg67Di" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PRO version</a>.
