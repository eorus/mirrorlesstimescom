### **4. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00WENHU6S/?tag=mirrorlesst-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Olympus 7-14mm f/2.8 Pro ($1,099)</a>**

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-828" title="10 Most Popular Micro Four Thirds Lenses - Olympus 7-14mm f/2.8 Pro" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.mirrorlesstimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Olympus-7-14mm-f-2-8-Pro.jpg?resize=600%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="10 Most Popular Micro Four Thirds Lenses - Olympus 7-14mm f/2.8 Pro" width="600" height="600" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.mirrorlesstimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Olympus-7-14mm-f-2-8-Pro.jpg?w=900&ssl=1 900w, https://i2.wp.com/www.mirrorlesstimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Olympus-7-14mm-f-2-8-Pro.jpg?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1 150w, https://i2.wp.com/www.mirrorlesstimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Olympus-7-14mm-f-2-8-Pro.jpg?resize=300%2C300&ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.mirrorlesstimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Olympus-7-14mm-f-2-8-Pro.jpg?resize=768%2C768&ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/www.mirrorlesstimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Olympus-7-14mm-f-2-8-Pro.jpg?resize=60%2C60&ssl=1 60w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" />][5]

Now let&#8217;s come to the product we propose to meet the need for wide-angle zoom lens in our list. It&#8217;s the Olympus 7-14mm f/2.8 which ist he best wide-angle option in terms of image quality and build. Although the price of this lens is similar to that of a Micro Four Thirds camera, the weatherproof construction and fixed f/2.8 aperture are invaluable. The focal length becomes 14-28mm to 35mm full-frame equivalent.

This is a PRO series lens means that it&#8217;s intented for serious outdoor photographers and high-end Micro Four Thirds cameras. If you think its expensive to pair with entry-level models than you might go for a cheaper wide-angle zoom option like the Panasonic 7-14mm f/4.

The lens has a price tag around **$1,000**. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00WENHU6S/?tag=daicamnew-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Click here</a> to buy it on Amazon.

### **5. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ISKNKA/?tag=daicamnew-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Panasonic Lumix 45-200mm f/4-5.6 ($300)</a>**

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-829" title="10 Most Popular Micro Four Thirds Lenses - Panasonic Lumix 45-200mm f/4-5.6" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.mirrorlesstimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Panasonic-Lumix-45-200mm-f-4-5-6.jpg?resize=600%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="10 Most Popular Micro Four Thirds Lenses - Panasonic Lumix 45-200mm f/4-5.6" width="600" height="600" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.mirrorlesstimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Panasonic-Lumix-45-200mm-f-4-5-6.jpg?w=900&ssl=1 900w, https://i1.wp.com/www.mirrorlesstimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Panasonic-Lumix-45-200mm-f-4-5-6.jpg?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1 150w, https://i1.wp.com/www.mirrorlesstimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Panasonic-Lumix-45-200mm-f-4-5-6.jpg?resize=300%2C300&ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.mirrorlesstimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Panasonic-Lumix-45-200mm-f-4-5-6.jpg?resize=768%2C768&ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/www.mirrorlesstimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Panasonic-Lumix-45-200mm-f-4-5-6.jpg?resize=60%2C60&ssl=1 60w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-recalc-dims="1" />][6]

The focal length of this lens is equivalent to approximately 90-400mm in 35mm format terms. This makes the Panasonic 45-200mm f/4-5.6 to offer a longer range than almost all comparable lenses for DSLRs. The telephoto zoom optic weighs only 7.4 ounces and features optical image stabilization to reduce camera shake. This would be the best lightweight choice for MFT system cameras.

The lens has a price tag around **$300**. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ISKNKA/?tag=daicamnew-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Click here</a> to buy it on Amazon.
