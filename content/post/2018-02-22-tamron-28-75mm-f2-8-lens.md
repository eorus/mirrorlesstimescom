Tamron is working on a _28-75mm F2.8_ lens for full-frame Sony mirrorless cameras. This is the Tamron’s first ever lens for the <a href="https://www.dailycameranews.com/2017/03/best-sony-full-frame-e-mount-lenses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sony full-frame E-mount</a> system.

The new high-speed standard zoom lens, **28-75mm F/2.8 Di III RXD** will offer a minimum focus distance of 19cm/7.5in at wide-angle, will measure 11.7cm/4.6in long and weigh in at 19.4oz/1.2lb. Tamron claims the lens will offer excellent optical performance and high-quality bokeh. An &#8216;RXD&#8217; stepping motor autofocus unit provides quiet operation for video applications, and the whole thing will be moisture-resistant.

The lens incorporates an all-new high-speed and precise **AF driving system called RXD**(Rapid eXtra-silent stepping Drive) which operates with remarkable quietness, making it perfect for video use. It’s also compatible with the **“Direct Manual Focus (DMF)”** feature that enables Sony cameras to instantly switch between autofocus and manual focus.<!--more-->
