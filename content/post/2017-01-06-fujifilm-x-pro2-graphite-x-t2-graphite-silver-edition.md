    <strong>New X-Pro2 Body with XF 23mm F2 R WR Lens and Lens Hood Kit, Graphite Edition</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The new<strong> X-Pro2 Graphite Edition</strong> boasts an all-new color to the X Series lineup. It has a rich, metallic texture due to a specialty multilayer coating. This edition will include the compact and lightweight<strong> XF 23mm F2 R WR </strong>and <strong>LH-XF35-2 lens hood</strong> in the same unique Graphite color as the body, achieving high resolution performance and a fast and silent AF system. The new Graphite Edition maintains the features of the current <a href="http://amzn.to/2hTCu9z" target="_blank">X-Pro2</a>. The new design adopts an extremely high-grade graphite color created through a multilayer coating process for the exterior of the camera body. By increasing the amount of black pigment component of the top coating, the camera achieves a more rich metallic texture.

    <strong>New X-T2 Body, Graphite Silver Edition</strong>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Fujifilm introduces the new<strong> X-T2 Graphite Silver Edition</strong> which will be supplied with tailor-made accessories including a premium leather strap, aluminum hot shoe cover and matching EF-X8 hot-shoe mount flash. This edition is treated with a multi-layer coating that is triple baked to produce an elegant and tactile finish. The first layer is a matte black undercoat, applied to the magnesium top cover. This undercoat delivers deeper blacks in shadow areas to make highlights stand out. The second layer uses Thin-film Multilayer Coating Technology to apply graphite silver for an incredibly smooth finish with a luxurious shine. The third layer is a clear varnish for a glossy finish.
