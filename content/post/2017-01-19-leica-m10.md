## Leica M10 mirrorless camera announced with 24MP full-frame sensor

The Leica M10 has a 2GB memory buffer that allows users to shoot continuous burst at 5 frames per second at full resolution for up to 16 frames.

ISO range has been expanded in the M10, allowing photographers to shoot at ISO 100 to 50,000 (up from 200-6400). Noise has been reduced at higher ISOs as well compared to predecessors.
