## More Panasonic GH5 Specs Leaked Online

The rumor mill is claiming that the Panasonic GH5 sensor might feature the same 16-megapixel Four Thirds sensor just like the [GX85][2] camera. As a video-centric device the rumored 16-megapixel resolution will fit well for the product.

So overall expectation is that the Panasonic GH5 sensor will be **16-megapixels in resolution **with better performance. It will also make the most of its output because of better processing and cooling.

The leaked Panasonic GH5 specs says that the camera will have **no crop for 4K video**. This means camera will use the whole sensor when recording 4K videos. Currently the GH4 uses 2.3x crop for 4K and this is only a part of the sensor.

A big news for professional filmmakers! The GH5 will also feature **4:2:2 10 bits internal recording**. This means that the MFT camera will produce very accurate color reproduction, especially with skin tones. On the other hand it also means much better LOG profile shooting.

Panasonic will hold a product launch event on **September 19**. They will announce the new G80, [the LX100 successor][3] and might display the GH5 prototype.
