Sony has unveiled a new <a href="https://www.playmemoriescameraapps.com/portal/usbdetail.php?eid=IS9104-NPIA09014_00-000018" target="_blank">Digital Filter Camera App</a> for its mirrorless and high-end compact cameras. The new app allows you divide your sensor into up to 3 sections and capture each of those parts differently. It’s like a graduated ND filter built right into your camera’s software.

According to the company, this application is perfect for scenes containing vastly different brightness levels, such as in backlit landscape scenes.

Digital Filter adds greater flexibility to a similar existing app called Sky HDR with ease of use and image quality. It is priced at **$29.99**. Those who own a copy of Sky HDR can purchase a Digital Filter license for $19.99.<!--more-->
