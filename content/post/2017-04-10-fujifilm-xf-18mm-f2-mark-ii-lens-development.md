Fujifilm is allegedly working on a new **XF 18mm F2 Mark II** wide-angle prime lens.

The rumor mill is back in business again. According to recent reports, the Fujinon **XF 18mm F2 Mark II** is high on Fuji’s “_**To Do**“_ list.

If it becomes a reality, then the lens will provide a full-frame **focal length equivalent of 27mm**. The optic will be compatible with all X-mount cameras, including the [X-Pro2][1] and [X-T2][2].<!--more-->

## Fujifilm is planning to release XF 18mm F2 Mark II lens

Current XF 18mm F2 R is a fast wide-angle prime lens in Fujifilm’s XF line-up of lenses. It has a price tag of <a href="http://amzn.to/2mR7nN4" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$599</a>. As expected, X-mount mirrorless camera users are demanding more such optics.

Besides the products listed on the [official roadmap][4], there are other units that might be in development. Trusted sources are stating that one of them is the Fujifilm XF 18mm F2 Mark II lens.

There is no mentioned announcement date for the product but we expect the lens will become official before other products that have been added to the X-mount roadmap by the company. This may well be the end of 2017 or the beginning of 2018. Stay tuned with us for more information.
