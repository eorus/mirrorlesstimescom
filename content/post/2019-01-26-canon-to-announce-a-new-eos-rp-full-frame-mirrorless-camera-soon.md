Canon is on the verge to announce a new full frame mirrorless camera called the <a href="https://www.mirrorlesstimes.com/tags/canon-eos-rp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Canon EOS RP</strong></a>. This rumor comes from one of the trusted source, Nokishita. They^ve found the registration data for a new Canon battery grip to come in three different colours. The name of the **Battery grip EG-E1** and made for EOS-RP camera.

We already know that Canon is working on **more full frame mirrorless cameras for 2019.** These models might serve APs-c and full frame sensors. This Canon EOS RP is well could be the next <a href="https://www.mirrorlesstimes.com/tags/canon-eos-r/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EOS R</a> (**$2,299** at <a class="ext-link" title="" href="https://www.amazon.com/Canon-Cameras-Digital-Camera-3075C002/dp/B07H484HLT/?tag=mtimes-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener external noreferrer nofollow" data-wpel-link="external" data-amzn-asin="B07H484HLT">Amazon</a>, <a class="ext-link" title="" href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1433710-REG/canon_eos_r_mirrorless_digital.html/BI/20175/KBID/14249/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external noreferrer nofollow" data-wpel-link="external">B&H</a>, <a class="ext-link broken_link" title="" href="https://adorama.evyy.net/c/63923/51926/1036?u=https://www.adorama.com/car.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener external noreferrer nofollow">Adorama</a>) series camera as an entry-level. See more about the _**Canon EOS RP specs and price**_ predictions.<!--more-->

As of now, we can only guess a 26MP full-frame sensor and no touch bar for the Canon EOS RP camera. If the Canon EOS RP as predicted, the entry-level full frame as a mirrorless camera, we can foresee that the sales price could be around **$1,500**.

<span id="more-2580"></span>From Nokishita Camera:

  * There seems to be 3 colors (black · red · blue?) In Canon’s “EG-E1” colorfulness 
      * Although “EOS RP body” and “EOS RP 24 – 105 mm kit” etc. are listed on the same list, it is an unknown list as to whether it is a product name or an abbreviation, so at the present time it is half.

Of course along with new <a href="http://www.guidetocamera.com/products/cameras/canon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Canon Cameras</a>, the company will unveil more native RF lenses in 2019.
