Nikon is working on a 1-series Nikon 9mm f/1.8 lens as the new patent application appeared in Japan.

The wide-angle prime lens with a fixed focal length of 9mm and a maximum aperture of f/1.8 is designed for their mirrorless cameras with 1-inch-type sensors.

When mounted on a 1-series Nikon mirrorless camera, the Nikon 9mm f/1.8 lens will offer a full-frame focal length equivalent of approximately 24.5mm.<!--more-->

## Nikon 9mm f/1.8 lens patent

If it becomes available on the market, the Nikon 9mm f/1.8 lens would be a great choice for low-light photography. But the lens will probably more expensive than the f/3.5-5.6 model because of a better maximum aperture.

A <a href="http://egami.blog.so-net.ne.jp" target="_blank">patent application</a> itself doesn’t mean the product will definitely hit the market but these kind of details shows us the current development progress and a sign of future products.

Nikon has several patents for CX-mount mirrorless cameras from wide-angle to standard zoom models. We can easily count the latest three as the Nikon 10-50mm f/3.5-5.6 VR, Nikon 9-30mm f/3.5-5.6 VR and Nikon 9-30mm f/1.8-2.8 lenses.

With the current growth of the mirrorless market we may see these products in development hit the market soon. This will sure give a nice fresh move on the Nikon CX-mount products.

Stay tuned for more information.
