Olympus **17mm F1.2 and 45mm F1.2 PRO** lenses are coming on **October 26, 2017**. First images of the bright prime lenses are also leaked on the web.

PhotoPlus Expo is one of the biggest imaging shows of the year. It will open its doors on October 25, but only the press and retail partners will be cleared for access on that date. Most of the announcement will occur during the first day, while 24 hours later the public will finally be able to see the new products in action.

Olympus 17mm f/1.2 and 45mm f/1.2 PRO lenses will become official on **October 26 at PhotoPlus Expo 2017**.

## Olympus 17mm f/1.2 and 45mm f/1.2 PRO lenses to be announced on October 26

One of the major benefits of the Micro Four Thirds system is the comparatively small size of the lenses. On the other hand both the Olympus 17mm f/1.2 and 45mm f/1.2 PRO lenses will be slightly bigger. The weight and dimensions vary because of the PRO lens advantages.

On the other hand Olympus might use the <a href="http://amzn.to/2h2BpMN" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Panasonic LEICA DG NOCTICRON 42.5mm F1.2</a> lens as a benchmark for its 45mm f/1.2 PRO.

_First images_ of the upcoming **Olympus 17mm f/1.2 and 45mm f/1.2 PRO lenses** have been leaked online.
