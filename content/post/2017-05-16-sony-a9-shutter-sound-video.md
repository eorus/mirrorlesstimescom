A larger buffer allows up to **241 compressed RAW** images or **362 JPEG images** to be captured in one continuous burst.

From the <a href="http://www.photographyblog.com/news/sony_a9_hands_on_review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PhotographyBlog</a> hands-on review :

> Sony are stepping into brand new territory with the A9 as they attempt to lure the pro sports photographers away from their Canon and Nikon DSLRs. In terms of specification, the Sony A9 outperforms its main rivals in most areas. But will it prove to be as mature and reliable as the Nikon D5 and Canon EOS-1D X Mark II?
