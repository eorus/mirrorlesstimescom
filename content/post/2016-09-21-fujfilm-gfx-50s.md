Fujifilm has announced the **GFX 50S medium-format digital camera** development at the Photokina 2016.

The Fujifilm GFX 50S mirrorless camera will feature the new G Format **43.8 x 32.9mm sensor with a 51.4MP resolution**. The camera is built around a new ‘G mount’ that will include zoom as well as prime lenses. Six new **FUJINON GF Lenses** that will be introduced sequentially in early 2017.

The first three lenses will be the GF 63mm F2.8 R WR, a GF32-64mm F4R LM WR and GF 120mm F4 Macro. These are expected in early 2017. The 0.79x crop means these are a 50mm, 25-50mm and 95mm equivalent, respectively.

These lenses will be followed by a GF 23mm F4 R LM WR and GF 110mm F2 in Mid 2017 and a GF 45mm F2.8 R WR in late 2017. Fujifilm GFX 50S with 63mm standard prime kit will be priced  under $10,000.<!--more-->

## **FUJIFILM ANNOUNCES DEVELOPMENT OF NEW GFX 50S MEDIUM FORMAT **

_FUJIFILM GFX 50S will give professional photographers the most extraordinary image quality in the history of Fujifilm _

**Valhalla, N.Y., September 19, 2016 **– In response to unprecedented interest from professional photographers, **FUJIFILM North America Corporation** today announces the development of the new medium format **FUJIFILM GFX mirrorless digital camera system** that will deliver unmatched and exceptional image quality. The innovative GFX system will reach a new Fujifilm photographic standard, and support its ongoing commitment to providing the total imaging solution for photographers.

**Photographic Excellence and Innovation **

Over the course of its proud history that extends over 80 years, Fujifilm has developed

and manufactured photographic films with advanced image resolution, outstanding

color reproduction and tonal qualities to meet the needs of professional photographers as well as photo enthusiasts. Fujifilm offers an extensive range of professional cameras under the consistent philosophy that “a camera is a tool for capturing your creative vision,” and high quality FUJINON lenses are an indispensable part of that commitment. All of the technologies and expertise of Fujifilm have been amassed to develop the new GFX, which uses a medium-format sensor to achieve the highest level of image quality and a completely new type of mirrorless system, and its companion FUJINON GF lenses.

### **FUJIFILM GFX 50S**

The FUJIFILM GFX 50S mirrorless digital camera will feature the new FUJIFILM G Format 43.8 x 32.9mm sensor with an astonishing 51.4MP resolution and six **FUJINON GF Lenses** that will be introduced sequentially in early 2017.

**Professional-use Mirrorless Camera System**

As a long-term manufacturer of photographic films and medium-format film cameras,

Fujifilm was always aware of the impact that different formats have on photographic expressions. Using a larger format gives an ultimate enhancement to a camera’s ability to capture “texture,” “depth” and “dimension,” which cannot be attained even by substantially increasing the sensor’s pixel count.

Since the launch of the X Series, an increasing number of professional photographers and photo enthusiasts expressed their desire to achieve the ultimate photographic expression with the X Series’ signature color reproduction. The GFX camera system with the G Format is Fujifilm’s response to their requests.

The FUJIFILM GFX 50S 51.4MP sensor can be adapted to various aspect ratios, including 4:3 (default), 3:2, 1:1, 4:5, 6:7 and 6:17, which were available in large and medium format film cameras. The GFX 50S will use the high-performance “X-Processor Pro” imaging processor to provide Fujifilm’s outstanding color and tone reproduction at an extremely high level. The result is the ultimate capability in photographic expressions that only Fujifilm can deliver thanks to its extensive knowledge in film and medium-format cameras.

### **Revolutionary Design Concept**

The FUJIFILM GFX 50S revolutionizes the concept of medium-format cameras, and compared to conventional medium-format digital SLR cameras, the GFX is lighter in weight, and achieves a far more compact form factor. With regards to functionality, the camera follows in the bartsteps of the X Series by featuring numerous physical buttons and dials, and is designed with an ergonomic grip, shaped carefully and optimized for the camera body and lenses.

The FUJIFILM GFX 50S will feature a detachable electronic viewfinder, which users can remove when using an external monitor or wanting to make the system even lighter. In addition, an optional adapter makes it possible to fit the EVF at any angle, giving greater freedom in the  
choice of shooting angle. Other optional accessories that will be available at launch include the Vertical Battery Grip, which enhances functionality when shooting in the portrait orientation. The camera also supports tethered shooting, which has become an essential part of the professional photographers’ workflow, and will be compatible with various RAW conversion application software.

### **Newly-developed FUJINON Lenses**

The FUJIFILM GFX 50S will use newly-designed FUJINON lenses with a new lens mount for highest performance and image quality.

A new lineup of **FUJINON GF lenses**, designed specifically for the GFX, supports the new G Mount. Taking advantage of the mirrorless system’s structure, the G Mount has the short flange back distance of just 26.7mm to shorten the back focus distance as much as possible. This prevents vignetting to achieve edge-to-edge sharpness of the world’s highest level.

**The initial lineup will include the following six FUJINON lenses:**

  1. Standard prime “GF63mmF2.8 R WR” (equivalent to 50mm in the 35mm format)
  2. Wide-angle standard zoom “GF32-64mmF4 R LM WR” (equivalent to 25-51mm in 35mm format)
  3. Mid-telephoto macro 1:0.5 “GF120mmF4 Macro R LM OIS WR” (equivalent to 95mm in 35mm format)
  4. Fast aperture mid-telephoto “GF110mmF2 R LM WR” (equivalent to 87mm in 35mm format)
  5. Ultra-wide “GF23mmF4 R LM WR” (equivalent to 18mm in 35mm format)
  6. Wide “GF45mmF2.8 R WR” (equivalent to 35mm in 35mm format)

**Additional Features**

The new FUJINON lenses will feature an aperture ring, a popular feature in the X Series, and have a new C (Command) Position on the ring to enable aperture adjustments with the Command Dial on the camera body. Each lens will be dust and weather resistant, built to withstand operation at temperatures as low as 14 degrees Fahrenheit \ -10 degrees Celsius allowing photographers to take them outdoors with confidence in challenging weather conditions.

  * 51.4MP Medium Format 43.8 x 32.9mm sensor for superior sharpness and image quality for all professional photographers
