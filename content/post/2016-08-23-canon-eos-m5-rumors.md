Canon is rumored to launch **a new EOS M mirrorless camera** <del>in late 2016</del> before Photokina. The product in question would be the EOS M3 successor which might be called the **EOS M5**.

As you might guess, Canon will hold an announcement for EOS M lineup on September 15, 2016. While the whole Photokina 2016 show means a lot for a new EOS 5 body for the company.

So there will be an EOS M announcement for Photokina 2016. The release date of the new EOS M camera and the lens should be in late 2016. Here are a few more details.<!--more-->

## Canon EOS M5 Mirrorless Camera To Be Announced in Late 2016

First of all the company will make a numeric change and jump to the **EOS M5** name. So the new EOS M camera won’t be called “M4”.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-493" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.mirrorlesstimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/canon-eos-m5-rumors.jpg?resize=600%2C338&#038;ssl=1" alt="canon-eos-m5-rumors" width="600" height="338" data-recalc-dims="1" /> 

We can think about a major upgrade over the current <a href="http://amzn.to/2bdHyhd" target="_blank" rel="“nofollow”">EOS M3</a>. On the other hand <a href="http://www.canonrumors.com/there-will-be-a-new-eos-m-camera-coming-in-2016/" target="_blank">rumor mill</a> notes that there won’t be big ergonomic changes in the body. It is easy to expect that the sensor will remain APS-c sized.

The new Canon EOS M5 mirrorless camera might also bring a new lens. It will be called **EF-M 18-150mm f/3.5-6.3 IS** standard zoom optic. The lens will be announced together with the MILC.

### Rumored Canon EOS M5 specs

  * 24.2mp (80D sensor or some variant)
  * Built-in electronic viewfinder
  * A new AF system (Could be the best new feature of the EOS M line)
  * A more classical camera design, more in line with Fuji or Olympus

The mirrorless camera from Canon to be announced on September 15, 2016.

**Canon EOS M5** camera to be announced in late 2016 before the **CES 2017 event**. Consumer Electronics Show starts on January 5, 2017 in Las Vegas. So a big possibility that we might see a Canon announcement after the New Year.
