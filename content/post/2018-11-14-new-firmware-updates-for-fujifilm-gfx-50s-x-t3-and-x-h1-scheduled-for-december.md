The remaining 2 axis (right and left pitch, yaw angle) was controlled by optical image stabilization in the lens. This firmware has a new image stabilization algorithm to allow the in-body image stabilization to work in all 5 axis and to achieve more than five-stops (up to the equivalent of 5.5 stops <span class="note">*7</span> ) image stabilization by cooperative control according to the types of frequency and blur amount.<br /> To activate this function, lenses are necessary to be updated to latest firmware version.
