Previous reports mentions that Oly may use a _20-megapixel MFT sensor_ made by Sony on the high-end Micro Four Thirds shooter.

The mirrorless camera will feature a very fast continuous shooting speed. This will sure make the shooter aimed at professional sports photography. Olympus worked hard to reduce rolling shutter to a negligible level. But it won’t have global shutter.

Professional cameras have dual memory card slots for a variety of use cases. The Dual SD card slot makes sense when we talk about a high-end model. The rumor mill also claiming that it will include an electronic shutter of **1/32000s and 4K video recording** capability.

Olympus is allegedly [working on several lenses][2] for Micro Four Thirds cameras. They are expected to become available in late 2016. The two of them will be fast prime optics. One of them will be the [Olympus 25mm f/1.2][3] prime model. It was rumored from the beginning of 2016.

These MFT lenses would be a good addition to the current lineup. As [Micro Four Thirds][4] users demand more all-in-one prime models.

So we have given you more details about the **Olympus E-M1 Mark II specs** sheet. The MFT camera will be announced soon together with the 25mm f/1.2 PRO lens.
