Samyang <a href="http://www.xeenglobal.com" target="_blank">announced</a> the release of XEEN 135mm T2.2. Along with the existing five lenses of 14mm T3.1, 24mm T1.5, 35mm T1.5, 50mm T1.5 and 85mm T1.5, XEEN 135mm T2.2 offers outstanding image quality from resolving power for 4K+ production for filming video and cinema.

XEEN is a specialized brand in professional video-cine lens launched by Samyang Optics in 2015. The XEEN lenses are designed with Samyang Optics&#8217; know-how and have outstanding optical performance for 4K+ with the X-Coating Technology, ensuring maximum image quality to create a cinematic look.

The new XEEN 135mm adds telephoto angle to the existing XEEN set, enabling to capture the sincere emotions and details of characters in films and videos. Also the bright T2.2 offers high quality footage with clear contrast and impressive colors, even under less-than-optimal lighting conditions. The large aperture also creates a pleasing bokeh effect for a cinematic look.
