From <a href="https://www.cameralabs.com/fujifilm-x100f-review/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">CameraLabs</a> Verdict:

> Indeed there’s better high-end compacts for general use, or you could always go for an <a href="http://amzn.to/2ruKS0h" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">X-T20</a> with a 23mm lens if you want the latest Fuji quality in a smallish body. But the X100F is a specialist camera, excelling at eye-level street photography, and will be adored by anyone who wants the <a href="http://amzn.to/2rv4aCB" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">X-Pro2</a> – and in particular its viewfinder – in a more compact form. If you understand and can exploit its unique benefits, I can recommend the <a href="http://amzn.to/2tE890n" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X100F</a>, and in the (likely continued) absence of an X70 update, it remains the smallest body with Fuji’s best quality sensor.

From <a href="http://www.photographyblog.com/reviews/fujifilm_x100f_review" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">PhotographyBlog</a> conclusion :

> It’s a beautiful camera, is great to use and produces lovely images &#8211; there’s just a couple of reasons which means it stops just short of perfection. If you’re looking to save money, take at the look at the still excellent X100T, or even the X100S or original X100.

From <a href="https://www.ephotozine.com/article/fujifilm-x100f-expert-review-30484" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">ePhotozine</a> conclusion :

> The Fujifilm X100F offers a unique shooting experience, and the exceptional image quality to match.
