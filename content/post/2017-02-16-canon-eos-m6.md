Canon has announced the **EOS M6** mirrorless camera with Dual Pixel CMOS AF. The new camera will be on display at the CP+ 2017 event.

The new EOS M6 shares essentially all of the M5’s internal components.  It is an upgraded version of the <a title="Canon EOS M3" href="https://www.dailycameranews.com/2015/02/canon-eos-m3/" target="_blank">EOS M3</a>, which was released in 2015.

The specs list include the **24MP APS-C sensor with Dual Pixel CMOS AF, Digic 7 processor**. The new MILC also capable of recording videos at 1080/60p. Bundled with 3″ touchscreen,  Wi-Fi, NFC and Bluetooth on the connectivity side.

The **Canon EOS M6** will start shipping from April 2017 in both black and silver. The price will stand at **<a href="http://amzn.to/2kw5pNt" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-amzn-asin="B00I9GYG8O">$780</a>** body-only, with the EF-M 15-45mm F3.5-6.3 IS STM for **$900** or with the EF-M 18-150mm F3.5-6.3 IS STM for **$1280**. The EVF-DC2 is priced at **$250** and also comes in black and silver. <!--more-->

The company also announced an optional electronic viewfinder called the EVF-DC2. This 2.36M-dot EVF can be used with the M6. It is smaller and lighter than the EVF-DC1 used by the M3. The MILC gains an additional top plate control dial compared to the M3, which should improve handling.
