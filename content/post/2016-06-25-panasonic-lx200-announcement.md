**Panasonic LX200 announcement** is rumored to happen before or at Photokina 2016 event this year.

The world’s biggest digital imaging show is Photokina and opens its doors in every two years. This year photographers and the people in the industry will meet by the end of September.

The company is on the verge to introduce a replacement to the LX100 compact camera. The successor model most likely called LX200. Prior to the event, more digital cameras and lenses are on the horizon. The Panasonic LX200 announcement might show up the [long-rumored GH5 camera][1] too.<!--more-->

## Panasonic LX200 announcement might happen at Photokina 2016

The LX100 hits the markets back in late 2014. It was the first model in series to offer built-in WiFi along with 4K video recording capabilities. Also Panasonic&#8217;s answer to the rivals like the Sony RX100 and Canon PowerShot G7 X series digital compact models.

Anyway time passes by and after two years, its successor will be revealed in the name of LX200. From the [previously leaked specs][2], the MFT camera will come packed with a flash and a neutral density filter to make the competition stronger.

The image sensor of the upcoming LX200 camera would be the same as in Micro Four Thirds format. It&#8217;s unclear if it will be the same 20MP one found on the <a href="http://amzn.to/290ortL" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">GX8 model</a>. On the other hand it might be the improved 16MP, like the one found in the [GX85 camera][3].

The price of the LX100 dropped from about $900 down to about $700. The LX200 should have a price around **<a href="http://amzn.to/290oPbx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">$900</a>** mark just like the LX100 was released in November 2014.

**Panasonic LX200 announcement** might also include several new products like the high-end GH5 model. As we are approaching to the Photokina 2016 event in September we’ll pass more information. So stay tuned with us!
