## Sony a7R III Reviews Roundup with Videos

<a class="ext-link" title="" href="http://www.imaging-resource.com/news/2017/12/05/sony-a7r-iii-field-test-this-is-the-best-overall-professional-camera" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer">Imaging Resource</a> published the <a href="https://www.mirrorlesstimes.com/2017/11/best-lenses-sony-a7r-iii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="exclude">Sony a7R III</a> field test claiming that the new <a href="https://www.dailycameranews.com/tag/sony-a7riii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Sony a7R III</a> mirrorless camera “**_is the best overall professional camera on the market today”_**:

> Does the Sony A7R III deserve the hype and excitement it has been getting across the photo community? After several days shooting with it and numerous hours working with both photos and videos produced by it, I have to say yes, it absolutely does. The Sony A7R III does a fantastic job addressing the concerns fans of the A7R II had, while simultaneously introducing new features perhaps few asked for.
> 
> It’s pretty clear that Sony was actively listening and taking notes on what improvements they needed to make to their third-generation A7R camera. This is probably the first camera I’ve personally ever shot with that feels like a true advancement in areas in which its predecessor was decidedly weak. Sony made the A7R II‘s terrible battery life into one of the A7R III’ strongest, most standout features. The autofocus was also dramatically improved nearly to the point of the incredible A9.

<a class="ext-link" title="" href="https://www.thephoblographer.com/2017/12/07/review-sony-a7r-iii-the-camera-so-many-of-us-have-been-waiting-for/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer">The Phoblographer</a> said “**_The Sony a7r III is one of the most perfect Sony cameras to date”_**:

> The <a class="ext-link" title="" href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-42-4MP-Full-frame-Mirrorless-Interchangeable-Lens/dp/B076TGDHPT/?tag=mirrorlesst-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-amzn-asin="B076TGDHPT">Sony a7r III</a> is a fantastic camera that is pretty much everything that every working photographer needs. Good autofocus? Great RAW file versatility? Third party lens support? Third party flash support? Improved battery life? Dual card slots? Weather sealing? I mean, what is there to not like. Anything that isn’t that great about the <a href="https://www.mirrorlesstimes.com/2017/11/best-lenses-sony-a7r-iii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Sony a7r III</a> can be overcome and in no way do I see it being a burden in the long run. The Sony a7r III is replacing my Sony a7 as my main camera, although I still still keep the original due to just how good it still is. I recommend the <a href="https://www.dailycameranews.com/2017/11/sony-a7r-iii-stock-availability-tracker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="exclude">Sony a7r III</a> for working professionals and semi-professionals. And if you get it, I strongly recommend using it with Capture One to make the most of it.

And <a class="ext-link" title="" href="http://blog.kasson.com/a7riii/shooting-an-event-with-the-a7riii/" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener">Jim Kasson</a> is happy with the camera:

> The camera is faster and more responsive than the a7RII in almost every way, which translates to greater confidence and less tension when shooting an event. That seems to include the autofocusing, although I can’t be sure without a real test.
