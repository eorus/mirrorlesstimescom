Samyang introduced the **35mm f/1.2 ED AS UMC CS** lens for APS-C and Micro Four Thirds mirrorless cameras.

The prime optic has a bright maximum aperture of f/1.2. The manual focus lens has been designed for users to isolate their subject from the background. It also enables hand-held shooting in low-light conditions. When it comes to focal length, it delivers a full-frame equivalent of 52.5mm when mounted on APS-C cameras and 70mm when mounted on MFT cameras.

The construction of the Samyang 35mm f/1.2 ED AS UMC CS lens includes nine elements in seven groups. Two elements are aspherical, thus reducing flaws and chromatic aberrations that would have a negative impact on optical performance.<!--more-->
