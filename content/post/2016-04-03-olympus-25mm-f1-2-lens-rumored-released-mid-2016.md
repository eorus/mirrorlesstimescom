Olympus is rumored to announce a new **25mm lens **sometime around the middle of 2016 and it will feature a fast aperture of **f/1.2**.

According to latest rumors, Olympus 25mm f/1.2 lens is on the horizon and it will be the first lens in a series of fast primes, which will most likely join the company’s PRO-series.

Olympus PRO series lenses for MFT cameras are freezeproof, splashproof, and dustproof. We can clearly expect the Olympus 25mm f/1.2 PRO lens is to be announced at <a title="photokina 2014" href="https://www.mirrorlesstimes.com/tag/photokina-2016/" target="_blank">Photokina 2016</a> which will happen in September.<!--more-->

Olympus is allegedly working on several ultra-bright prime lenses for Micro Four Thirds system cameras which is expected to become available during 2016.

Earlier this year these lenses were said to feature maximum aperture of f/1, but the company decided to change it. As compared to the f/1.2 version, the f/1 model would have been roughly **43% larger** and **230 grams** heavier. Also the production cost for the f/1.0 were double as for the f/1.2.

The first in the series is most likely be the **M.Zuiko 25mm f/1.2 PRO** lens and it has been developed to work with the new PEN-F camera. The autofocus speed will be 30% faster when used with the PEN-F than with the OM-D E-M1 model.

The rumored Olympus bright prime lenses will offer 12mm, 25mm, and 50mm focal lengths. The MFT lenses will provide a 35mm focal length equivalent of 24mm, 50mm, and 100mm, respectively.

These fast aperture prime lenses to be unveiled at Photokina 2016 along with Olympus E-M1 Mark II mirrorless interchangeable lens camera. Stay tuned for more information!
