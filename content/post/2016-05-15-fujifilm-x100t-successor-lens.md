Fujifilm is rumored to announce the **X100T successor** camera, as the X200 expected to arrive with the same fixed-lens of 23mm focal length.

There is a big probability of a new X100-series model for this year. Several rumors for the Fujfilm X200 have circulated on the web before. Especially the fixed-lens of the premium camera might be different in terms of focal length, [previous gossips][1] say.

Fuji expected to unveil the **X100T successor** in the name of X200 in the second half of 2016 probably at Photokina 2016 event in September. More details after the break!<!--more-->

## Fujifilm X100T successor model to feature the same 23mm lens

Fuji were very busy in 2016 with several new cameras and lens announcements. The company has announced the long-waited flagship **X-Pro2** mirrorless camera and **XF 100-400mm F4.5-5.6 OIS WR** super telephoto zoom lens that covers a 35mm focal length equivalent of 152-609mm.

The most anticipated feature is sure the focal length of the fixed-lens of the shooter. Fuji will continue the X100 saga with fixed focal lengths but for those who thinks of a different focal length will have to wait for another version.

Even there were some rumors about a bright 28mm equivalent lens on the Fuji X70 camera. The **X100T successor** will definitely coming with a new **23mm (35mm equiv.) lens**, not the previously rumored 28mm one.

The Fujifilm X200 specs list will employ a 24-megapixel APS-C image sensor, also found in the X-Pro2. The digital compact camera is also expected to have several improvements like the improved version of viewfinder with a quicker refresh rate for the electronic viewfinder.
