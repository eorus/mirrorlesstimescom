Fujifilm has released a new firmware update for its flagship **X-Pro2** mirrorless camera.

**Firmware update version 2.0 for the X-Pro2 **adds the autofocus algorithm to be in-line with the weather-sealed [X-T2][1] model. The new autofocus algorithm comes to the X-Pro2.

The only exception is the AF-C Custom Settings functions. The number of focus point will be increased from 77 to 91 points and from 273 to 325 points  to improve framing.

Fujifilm also announced a little firmware update **version 3.70 for the X-Pro1**. Many **Fujinon lenses got a firmware update** too. It simply improves tracking function of parallax correction in the OVF. Details and download links can be found below.<!--more-->
