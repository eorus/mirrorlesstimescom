### Main Features

  * Integrated Vertical Grip
  * Precise Autofocus system with AF Multi-Selector, All-Cross-Type On-Chip Phase Detection AF Sensor, and Intelligent
  * Subject Detection AF
  * Pro Capture Mode[4] and 60 fps High-Speed Sequential Shooting[5]
  * Dual TruePic VIII Image Processors
  * The World’s Highest Image Stabilization Performance
  * Integrated Vertical Grip Construction

To meet demands from professional users who place importance on a secure grip during shooting, the OM-D E-M1X features integrated vertical grip construction, designed to provide an improved grip with a deep finger rest whether holding the camera horizontally or vertically. The ergonomic design reduces fatigue when shooting for long periods of time.

### Redesigned Button Layout

The layout, shape, and height of all buttons and levers have been completely redesigned to enable users to concentrate on shooting through the viewfinder. A multi-selector is included in both the horizontal and vertical positions so that users can quickly shift focus areas while looking through the viewfinder. A new C-LOCK lever allows the user to select and disable numerous buttons and dials on the camera when in the vertical or horizontal position to substantially mitigate any the risk of accidental changes in settings.

### High Magnification, High-Speed Viewfinder

The viewfinder features a new optical design using an industry-leading magnification of 0.83x (35mm equivalent). This four-element configuration designed with aspherical and high reflective index lenses provides a clear, distortion-free display right up to the edge of the viewfinder. As found on the OM-D E-M1 Mark II, a 120 fps (progressive scan) high-speed frame rate with a 0.005 second latency are provided for stress-free moving subject photography.

### Advanced Durability and Reliability

The OM-D E-M1X clears Olympus’ in-house splashproof tests that are far more rigorous than IPX1 water ingress testing. The body is designed for shooting in the severe conditions professional photographers often find themselves. Dustproof, splashproof, and freezeproof (14°F / -10°C) performance is maintained even when the remote cable, microphone, and headphone jacks are in use, enabling shooting that is not affected by poor weather. A new coating is used on the Super Sonic Wave Filter, which vibrates at 30,000 times per second to remove dust and dirt, boosting dust removal effectiveness by 10% compared to previous Olympus models. The OM-D E-M1X also features durability and reliability to put pro photographers’ minds at ease, including construction that dissipates heat when shooting video and during high speed shooting in very hot conditions, which can typically cause the temperature to rise and limit functionality, as well as a shutter life actuation counts of 400,000[6].

### High-Capacity Battery

The OM-D E-M1X is equipped with a cartridge battery insertion system with the capacity for two BLH-1 lithium-ion batteries (also used in the OM-D E-M1 Mark II). Users can capture up to approximately 870 shots[7] and easily replace the batteries even when the camera is attached to a monopod or tripod. The camera also supports USB-C power delivery from a maximum 100 W USB-C standard power source with no special adapter required. This makes it possible to charge the two BLH-1 batteries in the camera body in approximately two hours.

### AF Area Multi Selector

A multi selector is included in both the horizontal and vertical positions on the OM-D E-M1X allowing users to quickly shift the AF area while looking through the viewfinder. A distinctive attribute of this joystick is that it allows for diagonal movement of the AF point, where most other cameras only allow for left, right, up and down movement, and in only one direction at a time. This feature makes it possible to smoothly shift AF areas during sequential shooting and video recording.

121-Point All-Cross-Type On-Chip Phase Detection AF Sensor The precise 121-point all-cross-type on-chip Phase Detection AF sensor currently available on the OM-D E-M1 Mark II is also featured on this model for more accurate and greater freedom for focusing in various situations. Olympus on-chip Phase Detection AF delivers Live View images and utilizes autofocus information from recorded images for quick tracking of unpredictable subject movement and changes in subject speed. The AF low-light limit when an F1.2 lens is attached[8] is -6 EV, allowing for high-precision focusing in both dark situations and low-contrast subjects.

### Various Autofocus Settings

Various autofocus settings are available on the OM-D E-M1X to meet the needs of professional photographers, including multiple AF Target Modes, AF area position settings when holding the camera vertically or horizontally, and turning the focusing ring in C-AF AF to instantly switch to manual focus using C-AF+MF Mode. The new 25-Point Group Target and Custom AF Target have been added to the available AF Target Modes for greater operating freedom.

### High-Speed Sequential Shooting

The OM-D E-M1X features high-speed sequential shooting at a maximum60 fps for capturing scenes in high definition that even the human eye cannot see. Both the 60 fps high-speed continuous shooting in AF/AE Lock, and maximum 18 fps continuous shooting with AF/AE Tracking can be used in Silent Mode for shooting a variety of activities, performances and events where the photographer does not want to disturb others with the sound of the shutter.

### Pro Capture Mode

Pro Capture Mode records up to 35 frames retroactively from when the shutter button is released with no blackouts (image loss) during shooting, recording at 20 million pixels and offers support for RAW capture. This feature has received high praise from professional photographers since its introduction on the OM-D E-M1 Mark II, and is effective for capturing artistic images of subjects that move unpredictably.

### Dual TruePicVIII High-Speed Image Processors

The OM-D E-M1X is equipped with two TruePic VIII Image Processors, providing quicker start-up times and recovery from sleep mode, and supporting the two high-speed UHS-II SD card slots for overall high-speed responsiveness. This not only contributes to a faster camera, but also supports new camera functionality, including Handheld High Res Shot Mode, Live ND, and Intelligent Subject Detection AF.

### Handheld High Res Shot

In addition to ultra-high-resolution maximum 80M[9] High Res Shot images that can be captured using a tripod, Handheld High Res Shot Mode is now available on the OM-D E-M1X, in response to many requests received from professional photographers. This feature is particularly useful for capturing high-definition shots in locations where it is impossible to use a tripod, including when moving from place to place, such as hiking.

### Live ND

Live ND is included on the OM-D E-M1X for slow shutter speed effects without the need for an ND filter. This new technology combines multiple exposed images in camera to attain slow shutter effects. It is also possible to check the slow shutter effects in the viewfinder before shooting for improved efficiency. Effects can be set in five levels: ND2 (equivalent to one shutter speed step), ND4 (2 steps), ND8 (3 steps), ND16 (4 steps), and ND32 (5 steps).

### Intelligent Subject Detection AF

Artificial Intelligence (AI) based Deep Learning technology was utilized to develop new algorithms for the Intelligent Subject Detection AF feature. It detects three different types of subjects, including motorsports, airplanes, and trains, focusing on and tracking the optimal area. For example, it sets pinpoint focus, locking onto the driver’s helmet during motorsports, automatically detecting the subject, enabling improved autofocus precision so users can focus on the composition.

### World’s Highest Image Stabilization

The OM-D E-M1X’s new gyro sensor enables superior image stabilization performance, delivering a maximum of 7.0 shutter speed steps of compensation performance[10] when using the camera body stabilization alone, and the world’s highest 7.5 shutter speed steps of compensation when combined with the stabilized M.Zuiko Digital ED 12-100mm F4.0 IS PRO lens. This feature makes handheld shooting possible at lower shutter speeds than ever before, which is perfect for nighttime and indoor shooting.

### Other Features:

Field Sensor System and Built-In GPS: The OM-D E-M1X contains a built-in GPS® sensor, temperature sensor, manometer and compass, collectively known as ‘field sensors’. In addition to location information, including longitude and latitude, these sensors detect and record the temperature, elevation, and direction of the camera for adding detailed shooting information to images.

Anti-Flicker Shooting and Flicker Scan: With anti-flicker shooting, the camera detects the flicker frequency of artificial light sources, including fluorescent lighting and activates the shutter at peak brightness to eliminate uneven exposures and coloring between sequential frames. Flicker scan suppresses striped patterns that can occur when using Silent Mode (electronic shutter) and when shooting movies, so that users can fine tune the shutter speed.

Olympus Capture: Olympus Capture camera control software now supports the transfer of recorded images over Wi-Fi®. This new feature makes it possible to transfer images wirelessly to a computer when shooting in the studio without connecting a USB cable. Both 2.4 GHz and high-speed communication 5 GHz bandwidths are available.

Handheld 4K and Cinema 4K: Powerful 5-Axis Image Stabilization and electronic stabilization enable ultra-smooth handheld 4K and cinema 4K video recording, without the need for stabilizing gear. Image stabilization effect can be selected from three levels depending on the photographer’s posture and movement.

OM-Log400: The OM-D E-M1X supports OM-Log400 shooting, which allows for shooting without loss of details in shadows and highlights and without blowouts, along with color grading via a computer for a high degree of freedom over images.  
High-Speed Movie (120 fps): 120 fps high-speed movies are now supported in Full HD. Slow-motion playback can make for more impressive imaging expressions.

### Separately Available Accessories:

#### FL-700WR Electronic Flash

FL-700WR Electronic Flash is a high-performance wireless radiowave shooting compatible electronic flash. During wireless shooting, it can function as a commander or flash with built-in receiver. The compact, lightweight design delivers excellent portability with high intensity at a maximum guide number of 42\[11\] (ISO 100/m). The dustproof, splashproof, and freezeproof (14°F / -10°C)[12] performance offers reliability when shooting in a variety of environments including rain, when paired with the OM-D E-M1X, and other splashproof and dustproof body and lens combinations. Full flash intensity is possible with an approximate 1.5 second[13]charging time for comfortable, easy shooting. Because charging time is short, sequential flash photography[14] at 10 fps is possible.

#### Wireless Commander FC-WR & Wireless Receiver FR-WR:

Wireless Commander FC-WR and Wireless Receiver FR-WR can control multiple flash units remotely from the camera, enabling versatile wireless flash photography. As is the case with the Electronic Flash FL-700WR, dustproof, splashproof, and freezeproof (14°F / -10°C) design allows use in a variety of fields. When paired with weathersealed cameras, lenses, and flash units including the FL-700WR or high-capacity Electronic Flash FL-900R, users can perform wireless flash photography comfortably even in the rain. The commander can connect to three groups and an unlimited number of flash units. Users can also select which group to fire and not fire and configure the flash intensity.

#### Olympus Workspace image management software

This new image management software delivers authentic image viewing and editing functions. RAW processing preview speed is now faster to streamline the post-shooting workflow. The rating function has also been improved for speedy selection of the best shots from large collections of images. A multi-window environment is now supported along with other comfortable controls for a more satisfying work process. Olympus Workspace can be downloaded free of charge for users who own an Olympus camera.
