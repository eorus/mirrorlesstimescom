It is designed to appeal to enthusiasts and professionals who are ready to take the next step up in photography. It is the excellent companion to create artworks from everyday moments, while the tiny AF 35mm f/2.8 FE released in June of this year is the perfect partner for everyday photographers.

Absolute resolution across the entire image field is the key feature of Samyang AF 35mm f1.4 FE.

The optical design minimises various aberrations and unnecessary light dispersion to deliver outstanding resolution. Fast, precise and quiet autofocus performance meets Samyang’s exceptional optical technology to capture any moments clearly. The bright F1.4 secures fast shutter speed and creates shallow depth of focus images in wide-standard angle of view. The new AF 35mm f/1.4 FE lens is ideal for professional photography including low-light events, landscapes and portraits with expressive characteristics.
