**Fujifilm X-E3** will be officially announced as a X-series camera with a larger EVF with higher refresh rate in late 2017.

<a href="http://amzn.to/2oxRadr" target="_blank">Fujifilm X-E2</a> might be replaced by the X-E3, as the Japanese manufacturer is planning to release the mirrorless camera this fall.

Moreover, the device is expected to feature the same 24.3 megapixel X-Trans CMOS III found on the [X-Pro2][1] and <a href="http://amzn.to/2nuFUPV" target="_blank">X-T2</a>. The X-E3 specs list to include a joystick. The screen of the camera might be articulated too. <!--more-->

## Fujifilm X-E3 Camera To Be Announced in late 2017

Fujifilm X-E2 will definitely get a replacement. In order to meet everybody’s demands, the Japanese company will probably add a new model to the X-E line-up.

If such a model will come at the end of 2017, we can foresee that there will be no 4K video recording feature in terms of price increase. Either way, the best thing to do is to keep all options open.
