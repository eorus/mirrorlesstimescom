<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDkJEEIifDzR_2K2p9tnwYQ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Tony & Chelsea Northrup</a> gave 1,500 photographers a blind poll and had them pick the image with the best color in several different scenes, including portraits in different lighting and outdoor photos. Which camera brand do you think got the most votes when it comes to color science : _Canon, Nikon, Sony, or Fuji _?

  3. Nikon 1.5x
  4. Fujifilm 1.4x – the lowest brand loyalty. According to Tony “ Maybe _Fujifilm users are the most rational people_“
