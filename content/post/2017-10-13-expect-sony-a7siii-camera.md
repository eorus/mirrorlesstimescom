Undoubtedly, the videographers who need 4K internat recording as well as 120fps slow-motion at 1080p with built-in 5 axis image stabilization, the full-frame E-mount model becomes ideal for their needs.

Sony has been rumored to introduce a new A7-series camera in late 2017. The device in question would be the third model that would be the replacement of <a href="http://amzn.to/2zkXStp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sony A7SII</a>.
