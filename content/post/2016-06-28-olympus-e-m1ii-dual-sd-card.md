The upcoming **Olympus E-M1II** mirrorless camera with** **micro four thirds image sensor is rumored to provide dual SD card slot.

Previously, Olympus E-M1 Mark II is said to feature a very fast continuous shooting speed which makes the camera aimed at professional sports photography.

After the mention of the new <a href="http://www.dailycameranews.com/2016/05/olympus-e-m1-mark-ii-handheld-high-res-mode/" target="_blank">handheld high resolution mode</a> which will help pro users for better stabilization.

## Olympus E-M1II specs list might include dual SD card slot feature

The Japan-based company is rumored to announce the new flagship Micro Four Thirds camera this year. Photokina is the worlds biggest digital imaging event and photo enthusiasts welcome new products in the industry from all brands.

[Olympus E-M1 Mark II announcement][1] is also scheduled for this event in September. We might see a **_20-megapixel MFT sensor_** made by Sony on the high-end Micro Four Thirds shooter.

It is not hard to guess that the camera will probably include **50-megapixel high resolution mode** introduced in the [digital PEN-F camera][2]. The rumor mill also claiming that the camera will include an electronic shutter of **1/32000s and 4K video recording capability**.

The company is also working on a new **handheld high-resolution shooting mode**. If becomes true, the E-M1II will be the first camera to use this feature. Current high resolution modes like the [Pentax K1][3]‘s Pixel Shift work by taking multiple pictures and combining them. This also makes the need of a tripod. If Olympus has managed to create a handheld high resolution mode than the users won’t need a tripod for extra stabilization.

We may also add the new and improved AF system to the specs list. The **Olympus E-M1II** will feature a dual SD card slot as well as a new viewfinder.
