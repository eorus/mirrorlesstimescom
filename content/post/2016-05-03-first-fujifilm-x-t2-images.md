First **Fujifilm X-T2 images** has been leaked online as the X-mount MILC has been spotted on a dealer website.

Fujifilm is allegedly working hard on several new cameras and lenses for 2016. One of them is the X-T2 mirrorless model which is [expected to be announced][1] before the **Photokina 2016** show in September.

The listing for the Fujifilm X-T2 at eBay UK shows the camera from the front with the XF 10-24mm f/4 R OIS lens. Currently the listing has been removed but when it was live the price were GBP 1,999 with the kit.<!--more-->

If rumors are true then the new camera will be unveiled two years after the X-T1 which was announced in January 2014. As a follow up to the first model it will be a weather-sealed unit.

When we look at the first **Fujifilm X-T2 images**, we see that the electronic viewfinder is bigger than the one on the X-T1. It is also larger than the hybrid one found in the X-Pro2. EVF refresh rate is going to be the same or better with the X-Pro2 and it will be quicker, so there will be no usual EVF lag when using the new model.
