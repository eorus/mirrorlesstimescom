A new high-end Canon full frame mirrorless camera is rumored to be in development and it will be able to record 4K videos.

The <a href="http://www.canonrumors.com/prosumer-level-canon-mirrorless-camera-to-have-4k-cr2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumor mill</a> is claiming that a Canon full frame mirrorless camera is in the works. It is expected to become official at Photokina 2016 event with two other EOS series mirrorless models.

The Japan-based company is actually working on three new mirrorless cameras. One of them is said to feature a full frame image sensor while the other two are APS-C-sized units. More details after the break!<!--more-->

## Canon full frame mirrorless camera rumored to become official at the Photokina 2016 event

There is a big chance that the new products could be announced by late August or early September. Photokina 2016 begins in mid-September and the products are expected to become official as part of this event.

So one of the mirrorless shooters will be based on APS-C sensor just like the [Sony a6300][1] and Fujifilm X-Pro2. The other one is a possible full frame mirrorless camera. The third model is expected to be a fixed lens mirrorless camera similar to the Leica Q and Sony RX1R II camera models.

The EOS M10 is Canon’s latest mirrorless camera, but it is not the pro-grade one that the company’s fans are looking for. The rumors about a professional Canon mirrorless camera have been circulating on the web for many years. So we might see the high-end Canon full frame mirrorless camera soon.

Here are the possible details of these mirrorless models.

  * Fixed lens mirrorless camera similar to the Leica Q and Sony RX1R II
  * New APS-C mirrorless camera just like the Sony a6300.
  * Full frame mirrorless camera

If becomes true, Photokina event will be a wonderful place for this kind of announcement. So stay tuned for more information.
