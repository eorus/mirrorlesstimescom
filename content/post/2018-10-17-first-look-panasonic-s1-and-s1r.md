[Lensvid][1] posted their video Interview with Panasonic about the upcoming <a href="https://www.mirrorlesstimes.com/tag/panasonic-s1/" rel="tag">Panasonic S1</a> and <a href="https://www.mirrorlesstimes.com/tag/panasonic-s1r/" rel="tag">Panasonic S1R</a> full-frame mirrorless cameras.

You can watch the hands-on video below and some notes about the L-mount system. To underline a point, physically they say &#8220;_the cameras are larger than the GH5. On the other hand holding the S1R in the hand feels pretty nice_&#8220;.  First check out this video where you can see a first hands-on video with the Panasonic S1 and S1R.<!--more-->

  


### Panasonic S1 and S1R Coverage

  * Both are FF cameras (the S1 with 24MP and the S1R with 47MP).
  * Both are based on the L mount which is the same FF mount used by Leica SL cameras.
  * Both will shoot 4K 60p video.
  *<img src="https://cdn.firstimpression.io/delivery/lg.php?bannerid=1840&campaignid=31&zoneid=99328&loc=%2Fgear%2Fpanasonic-s1-s1r-and-more-at-photokina-2018%2F&cb=009f6418ad" alt="" width="0" height="0" /> Both use 2 memory cards – SD and XQD.
  * Both will have a top screen and a monitor which flips but also can rotate to the side (but is not fully articulated – sadly).
  * The cameras are larger than the GH5 (but holding the S1R in the hand it feels pretty nice).
  * There will be 3 initial lenses (at launch) from Panasonic – 24-105mm, 70-200mm (apertures unknown at this point) and a 50mm f/1.4 (Panasonic also promises to have 10 native lenses by 2020 plus quite a few lenses by Leica and possibly some by Sigma).
  * Both cameras will have in body image stabilization (as well as some lenses that will also come stabilized).
