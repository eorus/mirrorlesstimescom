[Olympus E-M1 Mark II][1] uses a Sony-made Micro Four Thirds image sensor.

After tearing it down they confirm the camera uses the “Sony IMX270” sensor.  According to this report, the sensor on the flagship **Olympus EM1 Mark II** features phase detect as well as contrast detect AF points.

It is important to underline that the sensor isn’t commercially available to other camera manufacturers. It could be a sign that the sensor could be designed by Olympus and developed by Sony.

The [OM-D E-M1 Mark II][3] features a high-resolution **20.4MP sensor** and TruePic VIII image processor. The high-resolution **Live MOS sensor** offers fast shooting performance, along with impressive image quality. As a result the sensor provides an expanded sensitivity range up to **ISO 25600, and 4K video recording** capabilities.

The E-M1 Mark II is ideal for sports and wildlife shooting, the sensor and processor combination burst shooting rate of 60 fps when working with the silent electronic shutter function and single-shot AF, or 18 fps with continuous autofocus. If working with the mechanical shutter, up to 15 fps with single-shot AF is possible.

We know that several Panasonic cameras sensors are made by Sony. It’s unknown if the GH5 also uses the exact same sensor or a slightly modified version.
