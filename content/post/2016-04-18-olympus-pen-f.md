**Olympus PEN-F** camera has been announced a while ago with 20-Megapixel Four Thirds image sensor and built-in EVF.

The new MFT camera from Olympus is the revival of its classic 1960s half-frame PEN-F film camera in digital form. The shooter supports the world’s best 5-axis Image Stabilization system found in the OM-D lineup cameras and the sensor provides **50-Megapixel high resolution** shot capability.

Along with the 20MP image sensor, the first digital PEN-F camera features a built-in viewfinder with a real-time preview of settings adjustments and offers an impressive 2.36 Million-dot OLED panel. It also boasts a fully articulating 1.04 Million-dot 3″ LCD and can record full 1080HD videos at 60p.<!--more-->
