The Fujifilm X-T3 is an enthusiast SLR-style mirrorless camera that has a hybrid AF system with 425 phase-detect points and nearly 100% coverage. The X-T3 has a 3.69M-dot electronic viewfinder with a large 0.75x magnification as well as a touchscreen LCD that tilts on two axes. The tough magnesium-alloy body is sealed against dust and moisture and features twoSD cards that support UHS-II media.

Video can be captured at both DCI and UHD 4K at up to 60p, with a top bit rate of 400Mbps. The camera supports the H.265 codec and can output 10-bit video at 4:2:2 over HDMI, or record internal 10-bit at 4:2:0. Fujifilm&#8217;s F-Log format is supported at launch, with HLG support coming later in 2018.
