Here are the **first Panasonic GH6 rumors** that has been leaked on the web. [Panasonic][1] is rumored to announce the **Lumix GH6** camera. The official announcement is not expected soon, maybe a prototype at Photokina 2018. Release date of the Micro Four Thirds shooter should be at CP+ 2019.

According to latest [Panasonic rumors][2], the upcoming video-centric mirrorless camera will feature **8K support**. Along with the Panasonic GH6, the rumor mill claims that there will be several new models such as GH6V and GH6X. <!--more-->

Here are the first Panasonic GH6 rumors/predictions:

  * Panasonic wants to add 8K support, most probably at 24p only
  * [Micro Four Thirds][3] sensor can be first present only at GH6 presentation time and will be exclusive for 1-2 years
  * 8K support can be interpolated (from around 6.5-7K), but can be true 8K, depends on sensor version Sony chooses
  * Next focus will be improving high frame rates
  * AF will be kept at the same level, slightly faster, just with more options
  * Will use this EVF – <a href="https://www.personal-view.com/talks/discussion/19797/meet-first-gh6-part-1600x1200-resolution-oled-evf#Item_1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.personal-view.com/talks/discussion/19797/meet-first-gh6-part-1600×1200-resolution-oled-evf#Item_1</a>
  * GH6 can be the first camera with AI and cloud-based features with monthly cost
  * Other features can be possible to be enabled permanently, but paid, similar to V-LOG license
  * Panasonic also wants to account for big currency fluctuations
  * So, price will rise compared to GH5, but it can be GH6V (value edition) with 8K and other features disabled that you can buy later
  * GH lineup, after one year of introduction, will be 3 cameras – GH6V, GH6 and GH6X (top one, similar to mix of G9 and GH5S)
  * First announcement round will be Photokina 2018 and spring Photokina 2019 or CP++ will be release time
