> Yes, if I needed a small camera to put in a confined space like a car, or if I wanted to have a camera ready on a light gimbal. I would probably not use it on my main setup, because I work with a Speed Booster that never leaves my camera. For those shoots, I’d probably use the Laowa 12mm full-frame lens.

> The lens isn’t without its faults – since the corners at the fastest apertures are soft, the lens is only useable at around f/8 if you want the best results across the frame for architecture or landscapes. f/11 is also good but it is also the value at which you start to encounter some diffraction. If you are into astrophotography, it is important to be aware that there is astigmatism at the fastest apertures. On the positive side, central sharpness is excellent from f/2 and distortion is well-contained. It is also extremely compact and lightweight, making it a good companion for aerial photography.

> The primary value proposition of the Laowa 7.5mm f/2 MFT is certainly its extremely small size and low weight combined with a very large max. aperture. Upon unboxing, we experienced one of the few WOW effects during recent years.

> I will confess that I have had a macro lens on my wish list for awhile. This was not the one I was planning to purchase, but after using this loaner for the past few weeks, I really want to add it to my collection.

> If you are an Micro Four Thirds shooter and you’re looking for another adventure, you could do worse than stepping into the super wide-angle world of the Laowa 7.5mm.
