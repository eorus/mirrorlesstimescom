Fujifilm released the X-T3 this year as the successor to the popular X-T2. This is a massive upgrade for both stills and video. The Art of Photography published their Fujifilm X-T3 Hands-on Review.

The [FUJIFILM X-T3][1] is a powerhouse mirrorless camera featuring up to 30 frames per second burst rate shooting and internal 10-bit video at 4:2:0. The price of the X-T3 is **$1,499 for body-only** and now [in stock and shipping][2].

Below you can find the pros and cons from the video.<!--more-->



Pros

  * Face and Eye detection work well now
  * ISO 160 gives you better dynamic range than previously possible, but it reduced high ISO performance
  * PDAF everywhere
  * Great Image Quality
  * Lower price than the X-T2 when it came out
  * Major upgrade to video
  * 10-bit 4:2:0 internal and 10-bit 4:2:2 external
  * Eterna LUT for F-Log with good high contract control
  * It’s in Panasonic GH5 territory in many ways now
  * High speed shooting up to 30fps with RAW files
  * The 1.25x crop when shooting 30fps works to your advantage because your likely shooting sports and the extra crop will get you closer
  * Video AF works very well
  * Fujifilm finally has a legitimate video camera
  * Great job with power management, but should get the grip just to make it last longer

Cons

  * No Flip Screen
  * No IBIS
  * Still hasn’t caught Sony for AF
  * No tilty flippy selfie screen
  * Could really use a new battery
