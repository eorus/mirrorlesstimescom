First **Olympus E-PL8 images** has been spotted on the web ahead of the official announcement.

Trusted Japanese source <a title="" href="http://digicame-info.com/2016/03/e-pl8.html" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow">Digicame-info</a> posted the very first pictures of the Micro Four Thirds camera. When we look at the images, it will have major changes when compared to the previous version.

Along with the leather texture of the camera design we can clearly see the E-PL8 designation on top of the camera. The LCD on the back will remain tillable, even the mirrorless interchangeable lens camera becomes more classic style there is no built-in viewfinder.<!--more-->

## First Olympus E-PL8 images leaked online

The **PEN E-PL8** from Olympus will replace the current PEN E-PL7 camera which has been introduced back in August, 2014.

We have met an articulated 3-inch touchscreen LCD capable of flipping downward by 180° for selfie shooting with the Olympus E-PL7 for the first time. We can expect a similar tilting LCD display for the new model. See the top plate and the lens cap of the camera.

The Olympus E-PL7 mirrorless shooter with a 16-megapixel Micro Four Thirds image sensor that provides 3-axis image stabilization system. The specs list includes 8 fps continuous shooting and built-in Wi-Fi.

You can see the next MILC rear image showing the articulated 3″ LCD screen which will also be capable of flipping downward by 180°.

This is all for first **Olympus E-PL8 images**. The mirrorless interchangeable lens camera launch could be delayed because of the recent Kumamoto earthquake. So stay tuned with us and we will post more information about recent rumors and updates.
