Zeiss has introduced a **Batis 18mm f/2.8** lens with autofocus support for full-frame mirrorless cameras made by Sony.

The _new Batis-series lens_ is the widest model in the lineup and sure a great welcome for landscape and architecture photographers. The brand new wide-angle prime optic features an OLED screen, just like its siblings.

The first two Batis models are the **25mm f/2 and the 85mm f/1.8** as these optics deliver a very high image quality and provides the same dust and weather seals.<!--more-->
