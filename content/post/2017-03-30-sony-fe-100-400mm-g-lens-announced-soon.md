Sony is rumored to announce a new G-series telephoto lens soon. It is expected to be the **FE 100-400mm G lens** designed for full frame E-mount cameras.

The details of this lens, such as **aperture** information, size and weight is unknown at the moment. On the other hand the product launch event might be very soon in the beginning of April.

The FE 100-400mm G lens is expected to be announced with a high-end mirrorless camera which may well be the [Sony A7SIII.][1] <!--more-->

Let&#8217;s talk more about the upcoming **Sony FE 100-400mm G lens**. It will probably fit the pro-grade photographers in wild-life, action and sports genres. No price details have been revealed so far, but we do believe that the optic will be expensive.

When we look at the main rivals, the Canon EF 100-400mm f/4.5-5.6L IS II USM lens currently costs around <a href="http://amzn.to/2mS5HEv" target="_blank">$2000</a>. You can expect the sales price to be a little above this.

The **Sony FE 100-400mm G lens** is expected to become official within the coming weeks probably in late April. Expect the Sony A7sIII and a new RX model too.
