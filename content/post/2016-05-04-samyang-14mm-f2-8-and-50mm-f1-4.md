The first lenses with autofocus support will be offered in Sony&#8217;s E-mount mirrorless camera that are designed to cover a full-frame sensor. Both models are claimed to be fully compatible with contrast-detect as well as phase-detect AF systems.

Both the **Samyang 14mm f/2.8 and 50mm f/1.4** lenses come with a filter diameter measuring 67mm and a minimal design. These products have a metal-housing. The focusing system is internal and, as usual, this means that the front element will remain in place when focusing.<!--more-->

According to the South Korean company, the new 14mm and 50mm are the widest and brightest lenses in their class and offer superb quality images to photographers.

The optical technology provides aspherical lenses to be included in both lenses to minimise aberration and unnecessary light dispersion, delivering high resolution from the centre to the corners of the image

The 14mm f/2.8 ED AS IF UMC prime is great for cityscapes, landscapes, interiors, architecture, and other photography types that require a wide focal length. On the other hand, the 50mm f/1.4 AS IF UMC prime can be used for portrait photography even in low-light conditions.
