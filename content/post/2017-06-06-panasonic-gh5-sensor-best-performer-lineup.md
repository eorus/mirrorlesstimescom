[Panasonic GH5][1] sensor test results published by _DxOMark_. The video-centric Micro Four Thirds camera achieved a score of **77 points**.

According to DxOMark **Panasonic GH5 sensor** review, mirrorless camera delivered excellent all-round image quality. With a combination of 23.9 bits color sensitivity, 13 EV dynamic range, and 807 ISO low-light score – the Lumix** GH5 is the best performer in the lineup**.

The Panasonic GH5 is the world’s first camera that records 4K 60p / 50p and 4K 30p 4: 2: 2 10-bit video. The MFT shooter costs **<a title="" href="http://amzn.to/2iEyM0W" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">$1,999</a>**.<!--more-->

## Panasonic GH5 Sensor Gets DxOMarked

The Panasonic GH5 features a 20MP image sensor, presumably the same or a related sensor adopted by other high-end models such as the maker’s <a href="http://amzn.to/2ss3z5x" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DMC-GX8</a> and the rival <a href="http://amzn.to/2qMGadF" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Olympus EM-1 Mark II</a>. So it will come as no surprise to learn that it delivers scores that are among the best-in-class for this size sensor.

### Panasonic GH5 vs Olympus E-M1 Mark II vs Panasonic GX8

> Comparing the image quality results of the <a class="ext-link" title="" href="https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-DC-GH5KBODY-Mirrorless-Camera-Bluetooth/dp/B01MZ3LQQ5/?tag=daicamnew-20" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-amzn-asin="B01MZ3LQQ5">Panasonic Lumix DC-GH5</a> with the high-end <a class="ext-link" title="" href="http://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-DMC-GX8KBODY-Mirrorless-Camera-Stabilization/dp/B011B8QW38/?tag=daicamnew-20" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-amzn-asin="B011B8QW38">Panasonic DMC-GX8</a> and the <a class="ext-link" title="" href="https://www.amazon.com/Olympus-Camera-pixel-3-Inch-Black/dp/B01M4MB3DK/?tag=daicamnew-20" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-amzn-asin="B01M4MB3DK">Olympus OM-D E-M1 Mark II</a>, we can see that although all three appear to share the same or a similar sensor, the Olympus may have adopted a slightly modified version, or at least tuned it to deliver slightly better results at higher ISOs. In our our Low-light ISO test, it delivered just over a half-stop advantage over the GH5 and GX8, and there’s a similar improvement (if slight in real terms) in dynamic range and color, at least at higher ISOs.

From <a class="ext-link" title="" href="https://www.dxomark.com/Reviews/Panasonic-Lumix-DC-GH5-sensor-review-Best-performer-in-the-lineup" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer">DxOMark</a> conclusion:

> Like its predecessor the <a class="ext-link" title="" href="http://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-DMC-GH4KBODY-16-05MP-Mirrorless-Cinematic/dp/B00I9GYG8O/?tag=daicamnew-20" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-amzn-asin="B00I9GYG8O">GH4</a>, there’s no doubt the Panasonic GH5 is oriented toward videographers, but there’s still plenty to like about the camera for stills use. In spite of the increase in pixel count to 20-MPix, noise remains at the same level as the earlier 16-Mpix GH4. Even when compared to the maker’s GX8 that uses a similar 20-MPix sensor, the GH5 has slightly improved dynamic range and color sensitivity.
