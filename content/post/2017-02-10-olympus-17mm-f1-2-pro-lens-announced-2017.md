Olympus is rumored to be developing a new PRO-series unit. The product in question is the **17mm f/1.2 PRO** lens which will be announced sometime in 2017.

Camera and Photo imaging event **CP+ 2017** is approcahing and Olympus might show a new roadmap. Some prototypes are expected to be revealed and one of them could be 17mm f/1.2 PRO lens.

There are no detailed specifications and release date information about this lens. The rumor mill claims that MFT users will meet with the prime optic in 2017. More details after the break!<!--more-->

## Olympus 17mm f/1.2 PRO lens coming in 2017

The PRO-series is extending and it will allow photographers to benefit from wide-angle to telephoto focal lengths.  The last member of the PRO series was the [Olympus 25mm f/1.2 PRO][1] lens.

Now the company is working on a new unit for 17mm focal length this time. Just like its PRO siblings, the Olympus 17mm f/1.2 PRO lens will be **weathersealed**. So it will be resistant to dust, splashes, and temperatures as low as -10 degrees Celsius / 14 degrees Fahrenheit.

Olympus 25mm f/1.2 PRO lens has a price tag of **<a class="ext-link" title="" href="http://amzn.to/2cCUVuA" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow">$1,199</a>**. We can expect the same price for the upcoming 17mm lens. On the other hand this lens might be heavier because of the glasses used in the optical design.

After **17mm f/1.2 PRO** lens announcement, we expect Olympus to work on PRO series for new optics. A 45mm f/1.2 PRO or 75mm f/1.2 PRO might continue the saga. Stay tuned with us for more information.
