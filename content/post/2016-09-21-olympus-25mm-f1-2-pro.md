Olympus has announced the **M.Zuiko Digital ED 25mm f/1.2 PRO** standard prime lens.

The 25mm F1.2 Pro is a bright portrait lens with a 50mm equivalent focal length. The ground-up splashproof and dustproof design promises high resolution wide-open, as well as fast autofocus and well-controlled chromatic aberration.

Additionally, the lens boasts a “very fast” AF and Olympus’ advanced Z Coating Nano, which effectively reduces flaring and ghosts for even sharper, clearer images. The robust, metal-build lens features a maximum magnification of 0.11x (35mm equivalent: 0.22x) and weighs in at 410g.<!--more-->
