Fujifilm released firmware updates for several of its current X-series cameras as [X-T1][1], [X-T20][2] and [X100F][3].

The Fuji X-T20 has one fix about a wrong display issue when  “HIGH PERFORMANCE” is set and X-T1 and X100F firmware adds support for “**Instax SHARE SP-3**″. On the other hand X100F now has support for the FUJIFILM X RAW STUDIO software that has been announced last month. This also changes the User’s Manual of the X100F. See the <a href="http://www.fujifilm.com/support/digital_cameras/manuals/pdf/index/x/fujifilm_x100f_manual_en.pdf" target="_blank" rel="follow external noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external"><em>New Features Guide</em></a> here.

The Windows version will follow in late January 2018. We expect the X-T20 users will be able to process RAW files via the X RAW Studio soon.<!--more-->
