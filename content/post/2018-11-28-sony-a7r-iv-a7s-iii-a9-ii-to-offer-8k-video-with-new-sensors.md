Sony has developed two new full frame sensors capable of 8K, which will soon be released in two Sony cameras.

The two sensors will reportedly be available for both Sony’s own cameras as well as third-party companies that use Sony’s sensors. This means that we might see the **high-resolution 60MP sensor** on the **Sony A7R IV** while the **8K 36MP sensor** could be used on the upcoming **[A7S III][1] and A9 II**.

Interestingly Sony will make the sensors available to customers, which mean the 8K 36MP sensor could see its way into a [Panasonic full frame camera][2]. <!--more-->

Sony is rumored to announce two new sensors. New Sony full frame sensor will be capable of **60 megapixel stills, 16 channels, and 8K video recording**.
