The E-M1 Mark II from Olympus is said to feature a very fast continuous shooting speed which will make the flagship mirrorless camera aimed at professional sports photographers. We might see a _20-megapixel MFT sensor_ made by Sony on the high-end Micro Four Thirds shooter.

It is not hard to guess that the camera will probably include 50-megapixel high resolution mode introduced in the digital PEN-F camera. The gossips also claiming that the specs list will include an electronic shutter of 1/32000s and 4K video recording capability.

Olympus is allegedly working on several ultra-bright prime lenses for Micro Four Thirds system cameras, as [previously mentioned][1]. These prime optics are expected to become available during the year 2016. The first in the series is probably be the **M.Zuiko 25mm f/1.2 PRO** lens.

We will find out if there will be a bright prime lens during the Olympus E-M1 Mark II announcement event at Photokina 2016. Olympus will not waste any time in launching the product. The release date of the new flagship Micro 4/3rds camera is also mentioned for October, 2016. Stay tuned to Mirrorless Times!
