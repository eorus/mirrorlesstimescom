Blackmagic has released Camera 4.7 Update enabling RAW via SDI for **Micro Studio Camera 4K and Micro Cinema Camera Update 4.7.**

Camera 4.7 Update brings a number of significant improvements to both cameras. While raw output via SDI on the Blackmagic Micro Studio Camera 4K may make the headline, many users will most appreciate an extra 2 stops of exposure sensitivity.
