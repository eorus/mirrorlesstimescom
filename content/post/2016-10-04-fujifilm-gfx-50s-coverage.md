According to <a href="http://www.photographyblog.com/news/fujifilm_gfx_50s_preview/" target="_blank">photographyblog</a>, one of the main differences between the Hasselblad X1D and the Fujifilm GFX 50S is that the latter has a focal-plane shutter. It allows the shutter speeds as fast as 1/4000th of a second.

[Dpreview][3] also posted images comparing the size of the Fujifilm GFX 50S vs Nikon D810. Fujifilm will include a standard viewfinder in the box with the GFX 50S. This mean the adjustable viewfinder we have seen is the optional one and could hint at other optional viewfinders in the future.
