**10 Things You Didn’t Know About the Panasonic S1 and S1R**. As you know at Photokina 2018, Panasonic announced the development of two full frame mirrorless cameras: the <a href="https://www.mirrorlesstimes.com/tag/panasonic-s1r/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">47MP S1R</a> and the <a href="https://www.mirrorlesstimes.com/tag/panasonic-s1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">24MP S1</a>. Both will be built on Leica L mount. The company says the &#8216;S&#8217; represents cameras that are &#8216;Specialized&#8217; for professionals.

According to Panasonic, 24MP S1 is expected to be used around 70% for stills and 30% for video for wedding photographers and photojournalists. The S1R will be purely for photographers who shot landscape, commercial and portrait.
