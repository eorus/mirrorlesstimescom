**Hasselblad X1D** announced as the worlds first medium format mirrorless digital with an 50-megapixel CMOS sensor.

Along with the medium format MILC two new lenses are also announced. They are the **XCD 90mm f3.2 and XCD 45mm f3.5**. An 30mm optic will be added to these XCD lenses shortly at Photokina 2016.

Hasselblad X1D uses a very familiar 50-megapixel medium-format CMOS sensor. It offers a native ISO sensitivity between 100-25600 range and is capable of 1080/30p HD video. The company also claims 14 stops of dynamic range and an ISO range 100 of 25,600.<!--more-->

The camera uses a new mount compatible with new XCD lenses. The lenses has an integral central shutter, which enables the flash sync all the way up to the fastest shutter speed of 1/2000th of a second. Hasselblad’s H System lenses are also compatible with a H adapter to make up for the lack of mirror box in the smaller X1D.
