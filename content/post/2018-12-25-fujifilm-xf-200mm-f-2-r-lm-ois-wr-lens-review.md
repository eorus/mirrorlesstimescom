Here is the latest Fujifilm <a href="https://www.dailycameranews.com/tag/xf-200mm-f-2-r-lm-ois-wr/" rel="tag">XF 200mm f/2 R LM OIS WR</a> lens review. Kai Wong is sure that there is a temptation for Fujifilm to go full frame. But He says with APS-C sensor, they are properly killing this lens.

This is the first super-fast telephoto lens in Fuji’s XF lens range and comes bundled with a matching <a href="https://www.dailycameranews.com/tag/xf-1-4x-tc-f-2-wr/" rel="tag">XF 1.4x TC f/2 WR</a> teleconverter. The XF 200mm f/2 R LM OIS WR has a total of 19 elements, including one Super ED and two ED elements, and the front glass has a fluorine coating to keep away fingerprints and water.

XF 200mm f/2 R LM OIS WR Lens and XF 1.4X TC F2 WR Teleconverter Kit currently selling with a price tag under **$6000**. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/XF200mmF2-LM-OIS-Teleconverter-Kit/dp/B07FQB2T4F/?tag=daicamnew-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-amzn-asin="B07FQB2T4F">Amazon</a> | <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1424734-REG/fujifilm_16586343_xf_200mm_f_2_ois.html/BI/20175/KBID/14249/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">B&H Photo</a>. <!--more-->

### Fujifilm XF 200mm f/2 R LM OIS WR

Kai Wong tested the <a href="https://www.dailycameranews.com/tag/xf-200mm-f-2-r-lm-ois-wr/" target="_blank" rel="follow external noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external">Fujinon XF200mmF2</a>, and he is impressed with it.

  * no drop-in filters
  * smaller than equivalent FF lenses
  * with 1.4x teleconverter you get still very usuable images
  * crispy details
  * OIS works incredibly smooth, and combined with IBIS of X-H1 works very well
  * Focus is so so quick when used on Fujifilm X-H1
  * continous AF for stills and video is freaky reliable
  * Kai is sure there is a temptation for Fujifilm to go full frame, he’s sure they can. But with APS-C they are properly killing it
  * Bokeh: tree branches look a bit distracting
  * aimed for Pros and enthusiasts. Competing with Sony & Co in a smaller package
