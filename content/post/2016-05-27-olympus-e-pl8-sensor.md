More details are coming about the **Olympus E-PL8 sensor. **It is rumored that the upcoming PEN-series model might feature **16-megapixel** MFT sensor just like the previous model.

The PEN E-PL8 from Olympus will replace the current PEN E-PL7 camera which has been introduced back in August, 2014. The mirrorless PEN-series camera with Micro Four Thirds image sensor is delayed due to the earthquake in Kumamoto.

Now trusted sources has posted new **Olympus E-PL8 sensor** information and it looks like the upcoming model will come packed with the same 16MP resolution. The sensor looks like the same as the previous model and it will be made by Sony.<!--more-->

## Olympus E-PL8 sensor could be the same as the previous model

We have shared the first pictures of the Micro Four Thirds camera. Even it will have major changes when compared to the previous version sensor might remain the same, <a href="http://www.43rumors.com/ft5-olympus-e-pl8-has-a-16mp-sensor/" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow">sources</a> say.

You can see the next MILC rear image showing the articulated 3″ LCD screen which will also be capable of flipping downward by 180°.

Along with the leather texture of the camera design we can clearly see the E-PL8 designation on top of the camera. The LCD on the back will remain tillable, even the mirrorless interchangeable lens camera becomes more classic style there is no built-in viewfinder.
