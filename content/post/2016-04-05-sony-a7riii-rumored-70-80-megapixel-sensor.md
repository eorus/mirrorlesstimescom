Sony A7RIII camera is on the horizon and said to be in development.  The successor to the A7RII full-frame mirrorless camera will be called Sony A7RIII and feature a 70 to 80-megapixel image sensor with improved IBIS.

As we all know Sony has announced the A7RII back in June 2015. It is the first camera with a backlit full-frame sensor. The sensor has 42.4 megapixels without an anti-aliasing filter, and the camera supports in-body 5-axis image stabilization technology.

The upcoming Sony A7RIII full-frame mirrorless camera will come packed with a brand new image sensor somewhere between 70 to 80 megapixels, sources revealed. <!--more-->

## Sony A7RIII rumored to feature a 70 to 80-megapixel sensor

Sony is currently testing the many existing lenses to see if they are capable of supporting the new high-megapixel count image sensor. Because when mounted on the Sony A7RIII camera the existing lenses should support 60-megapixel or higher resolutions for stills and 6K or higher videos.

The announcement dates of the Sony A7R models has a sequence in order. In October of 2013, Sony announced the a7r, the world’s first 36mp full frame mirrorless camera in the Alpha-series. Two years later, Sony has released its successor, the 42-megapixel A7RII became official in the summer of 2015.

So we can expect the Sony A7RIII to show up in 2017 but considering the worlds biggest digital imaging event Photokina 2016 in September. It makes sense for earlier announcement of the camera for mid to late 2016.

Here is a short list of spec highlights for the Sony a7rII.
