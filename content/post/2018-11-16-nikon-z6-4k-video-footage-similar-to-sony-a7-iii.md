In terms of video performance, the mid-range full frame mirrorless camera outshines the [Nikon Z7][1] and similar to [Sony a7 III][2].

The [Nikon Z6][3] sample bartage below was all shot hand-held with in-body IS turned on using the Auto AF area mode and Fulltime autofocus (AF-F).

From <a href="https://www.dpreview.com/articles/8063289145/nikon-z6-video-bartage-outshines-z7-simialr-to-a7-iii" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dpreview</a> Nikon Z6 4K video bartage results :

> The Z6 and a7 III are taking different approaches to their oversampled 4K output with the Sony doing a better job capturing fine detail. The Z6 on the other hand looks to be using larger-radius sharpening (by default) which results in a punchier look out of camera. As expected, the Z6&#8217;s full-frame 4K looks better than the Z7&#8217;s full-frame 4K, which doesn&#8217;t use all its pixel rows, reducing both resolution and low-light performance. The Z6&#8217;s cropped 4K also appears to use larger-radius sharpening than the Sony&#8217;s and looks similar (but still slightly better) when compared to the Z7&#8217;s. Interestingly the Z6&#8217;s 4K full-frame bartage looks very similar to its 4K APS-C cropped bartage. There may be a bit of a noise penalty using the later, but detail is broadly similar.

> The Z6&#8217;s full-frame 1080/24p looks better both than the Z7&#8217;s full-frame 1080/24p and than the a7 III&#8217;s 1080/24p. As a whole, the Z6&#8217;s HD bartage has much more sharpening applied than the a7 III&#8217;s, but it doesn&#8217;t necessarily show much more tangible detail. This is also the case when comparing the Z6&#8217;s 1080/120p to the a7 III&#8217;s.



You can also find their video still for comparing the Z6&#8217;s various video modes to those of its peers, including its most direct competitor, the Sony a7 III.
