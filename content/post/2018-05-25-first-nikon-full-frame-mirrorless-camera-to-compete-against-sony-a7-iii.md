More information about [Nikon full frame mirrorless camera][1] continues to come. Accordingly, the first Nikon full-frame mirrorless camera will be introduced to the market as a rival to the entry-level [Sony A7 III][2].

As you remember, Nikon has been working on a mirrorless camera at professional level since the year we passed. One of the rumors that we are taking, the first Nikon full frame mirrorless camera to compete with Sony&#8217;s A7 Mark III model, especially considering the **D610 and D750 replacements** in the full-frame DSLR series.In summary, the company can register these developments by replacing the DSLR with a mirrorless model.<!--more-->

  * The new Nikon mirrorless camera will have features/functions never introduced beforehand (not sure if this applies to Nikon, to mirrorless cameras or to the industry as general). The camera was designed with ergonomics in mind.
  * At least one new mirrorless zoom lens will have power zoom (for video recording).
  * Nikon Japan should soon start sharing information with the parties involved in one month and we should start getting more detailed specifications soon.

2018 is the year for a possible Nikon full frame mirrorless camera development announcement. We will probably see the Nikon Full Frame Mirrorless Camera on display at the [Photokina 2018][4] event in September. Stay tuned with us for more information.
