Sony has officially announced the **A6500** E-mount mirrorless camera with an APS-C-sized sensor. It has become the company’s flagship APS-C mirrorless camera with **in-body 5-axis image stabilization** technology and touchscreen.

The successor to the A6300 uses the same copper-wired 24MP sensor with 425 on-sensor PDAF points but gains a faster (LSI) processor to allow high speed operation. As a result, the device shoots up to **11fps in continuous mode for up to 307 frames**.

The Sony a6500 will be available starting in November 2016 for <a href="http://amzn.to/2d6tWZ3" target="_blank">$1400</a>.<!--more-->

Inside the camera is a **24.2-megapixel Exmor CMOS sensor** with a BIONZ X processor. The native ISO range is 100 to 51200. The camera gains 5-axis image stabilization which continues to work in both stills and video.

It also gains a touchscreen for faster operation, particularly in terms of AF point positioning. The rear screen works as a touchpad if you&#8217;re holding the camera to your eye. Focusing can be selected on the **3-inch 921.6k-dot tilting touchscreen LCD** on the back of the camera.

The buffer has been significantly increased. It allows the camera to shoot at 11 frames per second for around 300 JPEGs or 100 Raw+JPEG frames. With the additional processing power this helps the shooter offer a faster image review when you&#8217;ve been shooting large bursts.

The mirrorless camera captures 4K videos without the need of an external recorder.  The MILC can shoot 4K video in the Super 35mm format with full pixel readout without pixel binning. It can do so at a bitrate of up to 100 Mbps using the XAVC S codec. It can also capture full HD movies at 50 Mbps.
