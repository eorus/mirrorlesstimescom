From French <a href="http://www.focus-numerique.com/cp-2016-rencontre-shugo-kiryu-shusuke-kozaki-fujifilm-news-9024.html" target="_blank">Focus-Numerique</a> website (<a href="https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&tl=en&js=y&prev=_t&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.focus-numerique.com%2Fcp-2016-rencontre-shugo-kiryu-shusuke-kozaki-fujifilm-news-9024.html&edit-text=" target="_blank">translation</a>) :

> We asked users of the X-Pro 1 if they used it for video and 80% of them said no. By cons, of course, you can make high quality videos FHD with the X-Pro 2. But according to our studies users do not expect 4K feature on the X-Pro 2. Technically, we could add this feature with a firmware update but we do not plan to do so in the future.
> 
> We will integrate the 4K video in the next models of the T series
