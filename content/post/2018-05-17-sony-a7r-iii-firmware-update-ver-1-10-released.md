Great News!! Sony has released the new firmware update Ver.1.10 for the <a href="https://www.mirrorlesstimes.com/tags/sony-a7r-iii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sony A7R III</a> full-frame mirrorless camera.

**Firmware v1.10** adds the 0.5 sec delay setting to the menu so users can halve the current shortest time between frames taken with the camera in Pixel Shift Shooting mode. Previously, delays of 1-30 seconds could be selected. The move will reduce the total amount of time the pixel shift mode takes to record the images it needs, so perhaps will also reduce the risk of movement in the subject.

Users can now also use exposure bracketing in silent mode when recording uncompressed Raw files, and the focus assist peaking display can be tuned when shooting in **S-Log mode**. Sony says it has improved the general stability of the camera and has fixed problems it had with Eye AF failing in when used with certain settings.<!--more-->
