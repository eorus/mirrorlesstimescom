From <a href="https://www.dxomark.com/Reviews/Sony-A6500-sensor-review" target="_blank">DxOMark</a> conclusion :

> “…for photojournalists looking for a small, compact, and convenient hybrid camera solution that offers great results up to ISO 1600. The A6500 is an excellent choice. Better overall image quality and improved low-light performance is available in the hybrid market by stepping up to a full-frame model such as the Sony A7R II, however, which is one of the best-performing cameras we’ve tested. ..”

**Sony A6500 sensor** results shows that if you need more fetures than you can buy a fresh model. On the other hand when considering the same result of sensor means that no need to upgrade.
