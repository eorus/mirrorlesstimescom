From <a href="http://www.dxomark.com/Reviews/Sigma-30mm-f-1.4-DC-DN-C-lens-review-Sony-E-top-ranking-prime" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DxOMark</a> conclusion :

> The Sigma 30mm f/1.4 DN is an excellent standard prime option for Sony E-mount cameras and ranks at the top for all lenses we’ve tested on the A6000. Sharpness is outstanding, delivering excellent center resolution at all aperture settings up to f/8, with only minimal drop-off in the corners. Vignetting is pretty heavy at f/1.4, as the lens struggles to achieve the same intensity of light across the large APS-C sensor at its maximum aperture. But it improves greatly by f/1.8 and is all but eradicated by f/2.8. The Sigma version is both sharper in the center and more consistent across the frame. Add to that the faster maximum f/1.4 aperture, and the $339 price tag it looks to be a very attractive standard prime option for Sony mirrorless photographers.

Sigma’s 30mm F1.4 DC DN optic which is designed to use on mirrorless cameras for Sony E-mount and Micro Four Thirds systems. It combines an amazing image quality with a lightweight and compact design. The construction consists of 9 elements in 7 groups with 9 rounded aperture blades. It also uses a stepping motor for fast and quiet focus during video.

Weighs just 263g/9.3oz, the lens is available for a price tag of <a href="http://amzn.to/1VVhrx1" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener">$339</a>.
