The X-mount 23mm wide-angle prime will provide a full-frame equivalent of about 35mm. It will be weathersealed, therefore it will not be bothered by sand, moisture, or water droplets.

Alongside the wide-angle prime optic, the company is rumored to announce several new products. The XF 33mm f/1.0 and XF 200mm f/2 lenses as well as the highly anticipated [Fujifilm X200][2] digital compact camera for Photokina 2016.

We have to underline that all lenses are on Fuji’s unofficial roadmap which means that the company may change their plans for future products.

As Photokina 2016 starts at the end of this September, the **Fujifilm XF 23mm f/2 WR lens** will be introduced ahead of the event. As usual, take it with a pinch of salt and stay with Mirrorless Times for more information.
