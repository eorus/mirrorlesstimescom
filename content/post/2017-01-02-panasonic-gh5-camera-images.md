## Panasonic GH5 camera images

From the **GH5 camera images**, we can it has identical dimensions as the GH4. Users of the good-old video-centric product says that the shooter handles perfectly. Now Panasonic listen to its fans and doesn&#8217;t change much when it comes to the body design. All we can say is that the GH5 has been sharpened up a little like the G85 model.
