See more details below:

  1. New design will be inspired by their long history of mirrorless cameras. It will neither be fully retro nor fully modern
  2. They don’t like the Sony A7 camera design
  3. They will appeal the professional photographers. They think only few professionals currently use Sony-Fuji-Olympus mirrorless cameras
