It seems like the Japan-based manufacturer is ready to launch a new member to this line-up. Latest rumors mentions a **Fujifilm X-A10** coming in November, 2016.

Back in late 2013, Fuji introduced the new X-A line up. The first device is called [Fuji X-A1][1] and it consists of a compact camera that also features built-in WiFi.
