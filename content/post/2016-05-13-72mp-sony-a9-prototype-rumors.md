The upcoming Sony Alpha A9 is said to have a **bigger grip** in dimensions. It will have a DSLR alike design and size. From the report the reader also says “_it is slightly larger than the A7R ii however it does not have a built in battery grip.”_ The camera has a joystick for autofocus point moving.

Sony A7II was the world’s first full frame camera with in-body 5-axis image stabilization. The next generation MILC from Sony will be a giant leap. The rumor mill says that the IBIS technology will make its way into future Sony A9 model.

The 72MP Sony A9 will be the next flagship model and will be capable of capturing **unlimited RAW photos** in continuous shooting mode. This means it can capture unlimited and won’t pause for buffering. It will also have **dual card slots**. Both slots will support only **XQD cards**.

### Here are the leaked specs so far

  * 70-80 megapixel sensor
  * IBIS technology
  * Unlimited RAW shooting
  * Dual SD card slot
  * Better HDR
  * Bigger grip

No information about the official announcement date. We might see it around [Photokina 2016][1] event in September.
