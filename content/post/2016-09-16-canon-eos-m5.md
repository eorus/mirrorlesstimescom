The **EOS M5** mirrorless interchangeable lens camera officially announced by Canon.

The new camera features a **24.2 Megapixel APS-C CMOS** sensor and Dual Pixel CMOS AF. Canon’s EOS M5 has a DIGIC 7 processor and a built-in 2.36M-dot EVF. It also has a DSLR-level AF speed and accuracy, 9fps continuous shooting, and Full HD 60p movies.

The 3-inch 1.62M-dot touchscreen tilts up by 85° and downward by 180°. It supports touch-focusing even when using the EVF. Wi-Fi and NFC are offered along with low energy Bluetooth that provides a continuous connection.

The Canon EOS M5 will start shipping from November 2016. The price of the camera will be [**$979 for body-only**][1]. It will sell for $1099 with the EF-M 15-45mm F3.5-6.3 IS STM or with the just-announced EF-M 18-150mm F3.5-6.3 IS STM for $1479.<!--more-->

## Canon EOS M5 announced with 24MP Dual Pixel AF sensor and built-in EVF

The new mirrorless camera from Canon features Combination IS with in-camera 5-axis image stabilization. While capturing video this is a first in the Canon EOS series. With a compatible lens attached, Combination IS leverages optical IS and in-camera digital IS to help create tremendously smooth videos.

The DIGIC 7 Image Processor makes the 5-axis IS possible even with lenses that do not contain IS, because the in-camera image stabilization functions independently to help reduce camera shake when shooting videos.

Additionally, the EOS M5 camera shoots impressive time-lapse videos. The camera also allows for easy panning by setting the optimal shutter speed after analyzing the camera’s panning speed and how fast the subject is moving.
