Here are the latest and updated **Sony A7III features**. According to the list the full frame E-mount camera will have the same **Joystick control, Touch Screen and 4K video** recording of the [Sony A9][1].

Sony is actively working on a new A7-series shooter which is expected to be called as the Alpha A7III. The announcement of the mirrorless cameras will happen this Fall sometime between October-November.

Even we still don&#8217;t know if the upcoming full-frame E-mount camera will have the same body design of the A9 or maintain the current A7II look. Anyway first Sony A7III features already mentions about the **24MP sensor** and the **693-point AF system** of the A9. More buzz after the break!<!--more-->

## Updated Sony A7III Features: Same A9 Joystick

The [Sony Alpha A9][2] offers **20 fps blackout-free burst shooting** with uninterrupted viewing and AF/AE tracking. Take a look at this incredible [Sony A9 shutter** **demo video][3] to see what 20fps _sounds_ like.

The A7III features include the 24-megapixel sensor and the AF system which will consist of **693 phase detection points. **We can easily say that it will come without the crazy 20fps frame rate.
