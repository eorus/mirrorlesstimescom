[Olympus][1] has officially announced the new _PEN E-PL9_ mirrorless camera with Micro 4/3rds image sensor.

At first glance the [Olympus E-PL9][2] looks very much like its predecessor, the E-PL8, sporting a similar rangefinder-like retro design. On other hand the core specifications of the PEN E-PL9 has lots of improvements.

The PEN E-PL9 uses the 16MP Live MOS sensor as well as the same TruePic VIII processor found on the <a href="http://amzn.to/2nJpt3l" target="_blank" rel="noopener">E-M10 Mark III</a>. They also have the same 121-point contrast-detect AF system with face and eye detection.

Main improvements on the PEN E-PL9 are the 4K video recording, 5-axis image stabilisation, a built-in pop-up flash, and Bluetooth. The camera now records 4K video at 30/25/24fps, and the 5-axis image stabilisation will help keep videos steady and smooth.<!--more-->

The PEN E-PL9 will come bundled with the <a href="https://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/Qreg4d9Kyl25LQC1hopGrJ8AAAFhcJHgIAEAAAFKAfe7XY0/https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/http://amzn.to/2C0Ju9Y/ref=as_at?linkCode=w61&imprToken=KqP9EE6R1OQmBiK-lnhqtQ&slotNum=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">14-42mm F3.5-5.6 ‘EZ’</a> power zoom lens.
