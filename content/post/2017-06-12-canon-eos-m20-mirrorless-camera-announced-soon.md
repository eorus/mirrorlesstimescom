The EOS M10 was announced back in October of 2015, so a replacement model is probably on its way. The upcoming device will go around by the name of Canon EOS M20.

Even there are no leaked specs yet, it might feature an 24-megapixel APS-C-sized CMOS image sensor with a DIGIC 7 image processor.

Anyway take it with a grain of salt and stay tuned with us for more information.
