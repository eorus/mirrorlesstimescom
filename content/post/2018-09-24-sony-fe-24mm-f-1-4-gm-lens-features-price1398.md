The lightweight lens design has been realized in part by the development of a new high power DDSSM (Direct Drive SSM) that delivers approximately three times greater thrust than the previous focus system. The lens has linear response when focusing manually, which is useful when recording video. A manual aperture ring and customizable focus hold button are also available.
