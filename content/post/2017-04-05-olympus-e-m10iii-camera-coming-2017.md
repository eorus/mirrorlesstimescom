**Olympus E-M10III camera** is rumored to be announced in 2017. So will the Mark III version of the OM-D-series E-M10 shooter employ the same 16-megapixel sensor as its predecessor?

Currently there is no leaked information for the E-M10III specs. However, we think that the most wondered, the new model will have the image sensor in the resolution.

We believe that the Olympus might use the 20MP Four Thids sensor that is introduced with the <a href="http://amzn.to/2nCAKQa" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">E-M1 Mark II</a> in a possible E-M5 Mark III. More details after the break!<!--more-->

Olympus [launched it][1] in early 2014 and the Mark II model has been [unveiled in 2015][2]. Now the Japan-based company will allegedly introduce the <a href="http://amzn.to/2nWf2IS" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">E-M10 Mark II</a> replacement in 2017.
