## The Nauticam NA-G9 Underwater Housing for Panasonic G9 {.null}

<p class="null">
  Innovation, ergonomics, and reliability are the hallmarks of the Nauticam brand. Every new housing design is carefully crafted based on feedback from Nauticam users around the globe. Feedback gained from the knowledge and experience of Nauticam owners results in every new housing design being better than the last.
</p>

<p class="null">
  Key camera controls are placed within an easy reach from the ergonomic, rubberized handles.  An incredible amount of design resources go into crafting this layout, but that effort pays off with unmatched ease of use. Controls on the housing are placed exactly where they should be for easiest access in water, regardless of the camera layout. A large, sculpted shutter release lever is placed at the right hand grip for index finger operation, and features a patented geared mechanism that improves sensitivity for tactile feel of half press and full press. To facilitate back-button autofocus, the AF/AE lock button (which can be reassigned to activate AF) is controlled by a thumb lever near the right handle. No other housing comes close to achieving this kind of ergonomic access to these critical controls.
</p>

<p class="null">
  The housing Locking Latch System has received acclaim worldwide for its ease and functionality. These recessed latches are equipped with safety locks, reduce bulk and require minimal physical effort to engage and release. Port changes have never been simpler than utilizing the Patented Nauticam Locking Port Release Lever. No wrestling, no twisting, no misalignment – just seat and lock. Lens changes are also easily accomplished without removing the camera from the housing using the lens release button logically accessed on the housing front.

**Viewfinders  
** 

The standard optical glass viewfinder is very good and travel friendly, but many photographers prefer the ease of a magnified viewfinder with adjustable diopter. Nauticam produces a “straight” 180º enlarging viewfinder and a 45º angled enlarging viewfinder to enhance the ease of close quarters work often associated with macro shooting. Both viewfinders have high quality optics, and allow bright viewing of the entire image. A patented external dioptric adjustment allows personal adjustment to a sharp-as-a-tack standard underwater and viewfinder changes can be executed in less than 30 seconds without using tools. Exceptional composition and focus accuracy have never been more accessible.

**Premium Professional Optics  
** 

Experienced shooters know a camera is only as good as the lens in front of it, and the same is true when choosing optics for an underwater camera system.  A variety of wide-angle and flat ports are available in the N85 system to accommodate a large portion of the <a href="https://www.mirrorlesstimes.com/tag/micro-four-thirds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Micro Four Thirds</a> open-standard lenses. configurations are extensively tested at Nauticam to determine the ideal extension ring length for best performance.

**Integrated Vacuum Check and Leak Detection System**

The Nauticam vacuum check and leak detection system is shipped with NA-G9 as standard equipment.  Combined with an accessory vacuum M14 valve (PN 25624), this monitoring system provides constant updates on the water tight and safe-to-dive status of the housing.  A simple color coded LED lighting system lets the user know that the vacuum is solid, or that the housing is losing vacuum. Leak detection is built into the same circuit, so if there is water intrusion, an audible and visual indication will occur.

The Nauticam system is temperature compensated, eliminating false alarms caused by a change in outside temperature, or from a camera heating up on an action packed dive.
