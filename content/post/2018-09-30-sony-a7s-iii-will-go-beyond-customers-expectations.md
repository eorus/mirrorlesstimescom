At <a href="https://www.dailycameranews.com/tag/photokina-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Photokina 2018</a> we didn&#8217;t see the [Sony A7S III][1] announcement. According to that Cinema5D interviewed with Sony Senior Manager Yutaka Iwatsuki about the release date of Sony A7S III and other future products.

Sony Manager said that the **Sony a7S III is in development**, but in order **to go beyond customer’s expectations, they need a lot of work and time** to achieve this. This mean’s the Sony A7S III announcement date may require longer than we probably imagine.

This also means that a possible Sony a7S III announcement will not happen at PhotoPlus EXPO 2018 in October. Maybe in early 2019 at the CES 2019 or CP+ 2019 events makes sense. On the other hand this could be a sign that the company first focus on high-end APS-C mirrorless camera (<a href="https://www.mirrorlesstimes.com/tag/sony-a6700/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A6700</a>).<!--more-->



Other notes from interview: Sony thinks 8K recording is very important in long-term, but not very import in 2020. And Sony has no plan on medium format mirrorless cameras, as they are still focusing on innovating full frame and APS-C products.

Below are the specs of the Sony A7s III we’ve posted earlier.
