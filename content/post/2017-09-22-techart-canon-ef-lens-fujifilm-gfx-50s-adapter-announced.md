The EF-GFX adapter currently supports AF-S mode for shooting and supports the lens Image Stabilization function (if applicable). Focal length and aperture data will also be saved into the adapter.

Techart is also working to unlock the AF-C and video-shooting feature. It is expected to be seen in future firmware release. The firmware of the adapter is user-upgradable and can be done by simply plugging the adapter into a computer via the Micro USB cable and running the update program.
