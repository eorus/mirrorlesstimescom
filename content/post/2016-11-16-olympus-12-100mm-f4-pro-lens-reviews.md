First **Olympus 12-100mm f/4 IS PRO lens reviews** now available on the web.

The [M.Zuiko Digital ED 12-100mm f/4 IS PRO][1] is an all-around zoom lens designed for Micro Four Thirds cameras. The latest standard zoom optic offers a 24-200mm equivalent focal length in 35mm format with a constant maximum aperture.

We think this lens would be the ideal choice for Micro 4/3rds users as it is dust-, splash- and freezeproof. This professional-grade travel zoom lens offers 6.5 stops of image stabilization when combined with company&#8217;s 5-axis IBIS. The lens is available for a price of **<a class="ext-link" title="" href="http://amzn.to/2cXgKVr" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow">$1,299.95</a>.**<!--more-->

> _It’s a day since the postman delivered this lens, and so far I am very happy with it. The extra reach, the ability to get close to your subject, the confidence you can have in the IS; all provide expanded opportunities for shooting. It’s going to be an excellent walk-around companion for the next few years._
