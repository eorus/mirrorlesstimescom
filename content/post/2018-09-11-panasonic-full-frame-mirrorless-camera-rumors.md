## Panasonic full frame mirrorless camera specs

Panasonic full frame mirrorless camera specs include **30-megapixel** in resolution,** 4k 10bit 4:2:2 recording up to 60p**, dual card slots and priced around **$3,000**.

  * The camera will use a new Panasonic sensor unsure of MP but believed to be around 30MP
  * Full frame readout in 4k no pixel binning, no crop in 4k 24/25
  * Internal 4k 10bit 4:2:2 recording up to 60p (all i frames in 24/25 believed to be around 200mbs)
  * Possible 4k raw recording (may be external output only, there had been some early difficulty with hdmi and raw output)
  * Two card slots not sure if they are 2 x sdxc or 1x cfast 2.0 and 1x sdxc (probably depends on whether raw recording is internal or external)
  * Early prototype had no ibis due to sensor size and other internal elements, may change on release.
  * New ff lenses will have is, unsure if all new lenses will have it but if there is no ibis then it would make sense.
  * Audio adaptor similar to GH5 with more robust connection and additional controls
  * There will be some type of variable nd, not sure if this is an add on adaptor or built in.
  * Adaptors will be available for other lens mounts canon ef etc… unsure if they will work with the nd adaptor.
  * Weather sealed body, unsure if it is fully weather sealed but speculation is it is shower /splash dust proof.
  * Headphone, mic, usbc, hdmi, flash to double as timecode sync as with Gh5s
  * Price estimated to be in the region of $3,000
