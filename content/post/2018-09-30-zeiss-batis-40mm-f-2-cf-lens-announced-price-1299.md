#### Zeiss Batis 40mm f/2 CF Lens

The ZEISS Batis 2/40 CF is able to tackle various photography challenges thanks to its special 40-millimeter focal length. From portrait and street photography to landscape and architecture – anything is possible with this high-resolution fixed focal length. &#8220;The lens is excellent for applications requiring normal focal lengths as well as common photographic situations where a bit more of a wide angle is needed. Our customers will enjoy a truly versatile lens which, thanks to its proven ZEISS look, and an outstanding image quality, is also ideal for close-ups. If you&#8217;re traveling light and decide to opt for just one lens, then this would be it,&#8221; says Pollmann.

Thanks to its high micro contrast and initial aperture of f/2, the lens can perfectly capture individual objects. Features like floating lens design for consistently high image quality across the entire focus range, the ZEISS T* coating for fewer reflections and weather and dust sealed housing and splash protection ensure maximum image quality in almost any situation. For creative work, the innovative OLED display on the ZEISS Batis shows the distance and depth of field, ensuring a perfectly adjusted focus range.
