The X100 series will gain another member soon. New **Fujifilm X100F specs** and details has been leaked on the web.

We are really getting closer to the replacement for the X100T compact camera. It will be the X00F model where the **“F”** designation in the name is speculating to be the fourth model in the series. The Japanese company is said to announce this digital camera at Photokina 2016 in September. Unfortunately it has been delayed because of the Kumamoto earthquake in Japan.

The premium compact camera will have an APS-C-sized image sensor. As you know both the X100S and X100T have used a 16.3-megapixel APS-C-sized sensor. Now the rumor mill claims that the **X00F specs** will include the **24.3-megapixel APS-C X-Trans CMOS III** sensor found on the X-Pro2 and [X-T2][1] mirrorless cameras.<!--more-->

## More Fujifilm X100F specs surfaced on the web

The current Fujifilm X100 line consists of three models. The <a href="http://amzn.to/2csTjX8" target="_blank">X100</a>, <a href="http://amzn.to/2bE7Xd4" target="_blank">X100S</a> and <a href="http://amzn.to/2bVjJA8" target="_blank">X100T</a> features the same Fujinon 23mm F2 fixed lens.

It will also have a built-in shutter and ISO dial. Furthermore, the device will be powered by an NP-W126s battery. As expected no 4K video recording feature at the moment. We think that this is also not important for Fuji fans, as this camera primarily aimed at street photography enthuasists. More X100F specs can be found below.
