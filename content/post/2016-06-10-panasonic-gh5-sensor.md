The rumor mill is claiming that the **Panasonic GH5 sensor** might feature the same 16-megapixel Four Thirds sensor just like the [GX85][1] camera.

According to recent gossips, the GH4 successor will offer a 16-megapixel image sensor with the help of better processing and cooling. This also means that the video-centric product will come packed with the sensor found in the GX85, but with better performance.

As we all know the GH5 from Panasonic will replace the current <a href="http://amzn.to/1ZDJDq6" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">GH4 mirrorless camera </a>which has been introduced back in February, 2014. More details after the break!<!--more-->

When we look at the previous rumors, the Panasonic GH5 sensor will offer a resolution around 20MP, with 18MP stills pulled from the 6K video mode in 16:9 aspect ratio. Now it is being said the upcoming model will come packed with the same 16MP resolution found in the newly announced GX85. The sensor looks like the same as the previous model and it will be made by Sony, <a href="http://www.43rumors.com/ft5-panasonic-gh5-will-have-same-gx80-sensor-but-better-performance/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">sources say</a>.

The upcoming high-end mirrorless shooter designed for videographers is expected to record 4K videos at higher frame rates such as 60p and 6K videos at 30fps.

To remember the Panasonic GH4 specs list, it includes a 16.05-megapixel Digital Live MOS sensor powered by a 4-CPU Venus Engine. The Micro Four Thirds shooter is capable of capturing high-resolution JPEG and RAW stills, as well as UHD 4K 3840×2160 30p/24p and cinematic DCI 4K 4096×2160 video at 24p. Videos can be recorded in a variety of formats, from efficient AVCHD and AVCHD Progressive, to 200 Mbps All-Intra and 100 Mbps IPB MOV and MP4 formats.

As a video-centric device the rumored 16-megapixel resolution will fit well for **Panasonic GH5 sensor**. The mirrorless interchangeable lens camera is expected [to be announced at Photokina 2016][2] event in September.
