Sony A7III _announcement_ date is _rumored_ to take place in the near future as sources claims the mirrorless shooter will be the mini Alpha A9.

The replacement to the <a href="http://amzn.to/2wUAVhG" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A7 Mark II</a> camera to be a trimmed down version of the A9 borrowing many of the features with a **lower price tag**.

As a result the mirrorless camera will have a 24-megapixel full-frame sensor and the **693-point AF system** found on the A9. Let&#8217;s look at the details before the Sony A7III announcement happens.

## Sony A7III announcement event allegedly happening soon

The [_Sony_ Alpha 9][1] is the company&#8217;s first camera aimed at professional wedding, action and sports photographers. It&#8217;s a full-frame mirrorless camera that can shoot at 20 frames per second with full autofocus.

Unlike the amazing 20fps electronic shutter on the mirrorless sports camera, the Sony A7III will have only **6fps**.
