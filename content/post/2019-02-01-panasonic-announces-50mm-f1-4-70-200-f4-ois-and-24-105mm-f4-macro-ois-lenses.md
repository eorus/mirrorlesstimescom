[Panasonic][1] unveil a trio of Lumix S lenses along the S1R and the S1 full-frame mirrorless cameras. The <a href="https://www.mirrorlesstimes.com/tags/panasonic-s1r/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">47MP S1R</a> and the <a href="https://www.mirrorlesstimes.com/tags/panasonic-s1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">24MP S1</a> full-frame mirrorless cameras will **start shipping by the end of March**.

The three new lenses are <a href="https://www.mirrorlesstimes.com/tags/panasonic-s-24-105mm-l-mount-lens/" rel="tag">Panasonic S 24-105mm L-Mount Lens</a>, <a href="https://www.mirrorlesstimes.com/tags/panasonic-s-50mm-f-1-4-l-mount-lens/" rel="tag">Panasonic S 50mm f/1.4 L-Mount Lens</a>, <a href="https://www.mirrorlesstimes.com/tags/panasonic-s-70-200mm-f-2-8-l-mount-lens/" rel="tag">Panasonic S 70-200mm f/2.8 L-Mount Lens</a>. The 24-105mm F4 OIS Macro will serve as the kit lens for both cameras. All three lenses are dust and moisture-sealed, and the two &#8216;S Pro&#8217; models include a focus clutch for quick switching between auto and manual focus.

The three new lenses will ship in early April. The 50mm F1.4 is priced at $2299, the 70-200 F4 at $1699 and the 24-105mm F4 at $1299. Buying the S1/S1R kit effectively lowers the price of the 24-105mm F4 to $899.<!--more-->

## Panasonic Launches Three L-Mount Interchangeable Lenses for the LUMIX S Series Full-frame Digital Single Lens Mirrorless Camera

**LUMIX S PRO 50mm F1.4 (S-X50), LUMIX S PRO 70-200mm F4 O.I.S. (S-R70200) and LUMIX S 24-105mm F4 MACRO O.I.S. (S-R24105)**

**Newark, NJ (February 1, 2019) &#8211; **Panasonic is proud to introduce three new interchangeable lenses based on the L-Mount system for the LUMIX S Series Full-frame Digital Single Lens Mirrorless Camera. Specially focusing on professional use, the LUMIX S Series pursues uncompromising photographic expression with its high-quality cameras and lenses.

The L-Mount is a lens mount for mirrorless cameras that was launched by Leica and is equally suitable for both the APS-C format and full-frame cameras. Leica Camera, Panasonic and Sigma are set to offer a user-friendly solution that will allow photographers to ‘mix and match’ any of the three manufacturers’ APS-C and full-frame cameras with any lens from each other’s product portfolios. The aim of the L-Mount Alliance is to provide customers with a diverse and future-proof range of products. The advantages are a large inner diameter of 51.6 mm that enables the realization of extremely fast lenses and extremely compact dimensions. The configuration of the lens-to-camera communication interface is future-proof and the L-Mount also offers an option for the construction of sealed systems that are insensitive to dust and moisture.　The L-Mount thereby opens up an almost limitless spectrum of new creative possibilities.

All interchangeable lenses of the LUMIX S Series provide high performance yet the “LUMIX S PRO” lenses further boast ultimate optical performance to be certified by LEICA for clearing stringent LEICA standards. Panasonic is committed to designing and developing 10 or more lenses with a focus on “LUMIX S PRO” lenses by 2020 and further expanding the S Series lens lineup.

### <u>LUMIX S PRO 50mm F1.4 (S-X50)</u>

The LUMIX S PRO 50mm F1.4 is a large-aperture fixed focal length LUMIX S PRO lens that is the core of all LUMIX S Series lenses. Ensuring versatile use with its 50mm focal length and F1.4 high speed, the LUMIX S PRO 50mm F1.4 boasts stunningly high resolution and a descriptive performance from the center to the corners of the image despite its large aperture. It provides smooth defocus gradation from the focus peak to the neighboring area of the image. It also describes the point light sources in the background as impressive, beautiful bokeh. The optical performance of this LUMIX S PRO lens is outstandingly high to clear stringent LEICA standards.

Comprising 13 lenses in 11 groups, the use of 2 aspherical lenses and 3 ED (Extra-low Dispersion) lenses effectively suppresses both axial chromatic aberration and chromatic aberration of magnification. Astigmatism is also corrected with those aspherical lenses, achieving high resolving performance.

A double focus system combining a linear motor and stepping motor achieves sensor drive at a maximum speed of 480 fps. It realizes fast, high-precision AF to ensure that you will never miss a photo opportunity. Adoption of a focus clutch mechanism enables instant AF/MF switching and accurate manual focusing. The LUMIX S PRO 50mm F1.4 also excels in video recording performance with a mechanism that suppresses focus breathing, which was a fatal problem of all interchangeable lenses designed for still image photography.

The refined design of the LUMIX S Series provides high operability as a tool for professionals. The rugged dust/splash-resistant<span class="green">*</span> design withstand use under harsh conditions even in 10 degrees below zero for high mobility. The filter diameter is 77mm, with an 11-blade circular aperture diaphragm.

<span class="green">*Dust and Splash Resistant does not guarantee that damage will not occur if this lens is subjected to direct contact with dust and water.</span>

### <u>LUMIX S PRO 70-200mm F4 O.I.S. (S-R70200)</u>

The second lens is also a LUMIX S PRO lens. The LUMIX S PRO 70-200mm F4 O.I.S. telephoto zoom lens provides high-resolution, high-contrast images across the entire zoom range. It can be used for wide-ranging situations, from portraits to sports. Panasonic LUMIX’s image stabilization system 5-Axis Dual I.S. (Image Stabilizer) 2<span class="green">*<sup>1</sup></span> can be used with the LUMIX S PRO 70-200mm F4 O.I.S. for the first time as a lens of a full-frame mirrorless camera system, to ensure that you will never miss a photo opportunity. The optical performance of this LUMIX S PRO lens is outstandingly high to clear stringent LEICA standards.

The lens unit comprises 23 lenses in 17 groups and the use of an aspherical lens and 3 ED (Extra-low Dispersion) lenses effectively suppresses both axial chromatic aberration and chromatic aberration of magnification. Designed in pursuit of optimum lens alignment, it achieves beautiful bokeh with minimum vignetting.

The O.I.S. (Optical Image Stabilizer) in the lens effectively compensates for the hand-shake movement, making it easy to shoot even without a tripod or in low-lit situations. Complying with the camera’s Body I.S., the 5-Axis Dual I.S. 2<span class="green">*<sup>1</sup></span> makes it possible to use 6-stop slower shutter speed<span class="green">*<sup>2</sup></span>. The high-precision linear motor achieves sensor drive at a maximum speed of 480 fps for fast auto focusing. The adoption of a focus clutch mechanism enables instant AF/MF switching and accurate manual focusing. The LUMIX S PRO 70-200mm F4 O.I.S. also excels in video recording performance with a mechanism that suppresses focus breathing, which was a fatal problem of all interchangeable lenses designed for still image photography.

### <u>LUMIX S 24-105mm F4 MACRO O.I.S. (S-R24105)</u>

The LUMIX S 24-105mm F4 MACRO O.I.S. is a versatile standard zoom lens covering wide-angle to medium-telephoto. It assures high descriptive performance across the entire zoom range. In addition to its versatile use with a wide and long zoom range, the LUMIX S 24-105mm F4 MACRO O.I.S. enables 0.5x macro shooting with a minimum focusing distance of 0.3m. Panasonic LUMIX’s image stabilization system 5-Axis Dual I.S. (Image Stabilizer) 2<span class="green">*<sup>1</sup></span> can be used with LUMIX S 24-105mm F4 MACRO O.I.S. for the first time as a lens of full-frame mirrorless camera system, never to miss the photo opportunity.
