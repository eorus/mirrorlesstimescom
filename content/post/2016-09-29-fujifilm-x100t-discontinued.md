There were rumors floating around for a possible X100T successor camera. We didn’t see a replacement for this series at Photokina event.<!--more-->

## Fujifilm X100T camera listed as discontinued

The X100 series will gain another member soon. Fujifilm is allegedly working on a new X100T successor camera. It is rumored to be named as <a href="https://www.mirrorlesstimes.com/2016/09/fujifilm-x100f-rumors/" target="_blank"><strong>Fujifilm X100F</strong></a>. Fuji lovers can wait for the early 2017 for good surprises.

Fujifilm X100T is the top X-series compact model announced back in 2015. Now the successor model is in the talks as the new camera will not be named [Fujifilm X200][1] as previously rumored. It will be called as **Fujifilm X100F**. As expected it will have an APS-C-sized image sensor.

The current Fujifilm X100 line consists of three models. The <a href="http://amzn.to/2csTjX8" target="_blank">X100</a>, <a href="http://amzn.to/2bE7Xd4" target="_blank">X100S</a> and <a href="http://amzn.to/2bVjJA8" target="_blank">X100T</a> features the same Fujinon 23mm F2 fixed lens. The “**F**” designation in the name is speculating to be the fourth model in the series.

Hopefully the new model might get some of the latest sensor from the new X-Pro2 and [X-T2][2] models. So prepare for a 24MP sensor available on the X-Pro2!

Fuji is currently focusing on the X-T2 camera. They had to deal with a shortage of X-Trans III sensor because of Kumamoto earthquake in Japan. That’s why it is being said that **Fujifilm X100F** will be released in early 2017. Stay tuned with us and we’ll give more information about this exciting camera.
