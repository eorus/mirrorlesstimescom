According to recent reviews, the <a href="https://www.mirrorlesstimes.com/tags/sony-a7-iii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sony A7 III</a> full frame mirrorless camera has no star eater issue. Looks like Sony has resolved the problem.

The “Star Eater” problem is a form of software spatial filtering designed to reduce noise in photos, particularly hot pixels.

> I did not see any significant “star eating” in any long exposures even up to the 4 minutes I used for some deep-sky shots. In images taken at the same time with other cameras not accused of star eating, the Sony showed just as many faint stars as the competitors. Long exposures showed just as many stars as did short exposures.
> 
> This was true whether I was shooting compressed or uncompressed RAW photos, with or without Long Exposure Noise Reduction. Neither compression nor LENR invoked “star eating.
