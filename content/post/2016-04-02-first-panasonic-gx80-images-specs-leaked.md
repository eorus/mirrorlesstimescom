The first **Panasonic GX80 images** and specs have been leaked on the web as the entry-level Micro Four Thirds camera is to be announced in a few days.

When we look at the first leaked Panasonic GX80 images, the design looks very similar to the high-end Lumix GX8 model. As expected the upcoming Lumix GX80 camera will be a stripped-down version of the Lumix GX8.

However it will be slightly bigger than the GM5 camera and it will still remain as the the world’s smallest mirrorless interchangeable lens camera.<!--more-->

## Panasonic GX80 images and specifications leaked online

The Panasonic GX80 will feature a 16-megapixel Micro Four Thirds sensor without an anti-aliasing filter. It is the first camera in its series to not have an AA filter. This feature will probably provide improved sharpness on the images.

The GX80 specs list will also include a brand new Venus image processor, which is capable of offering 4K video recording support. 4K post-focus option will also be available to choose just like the GX8, GF7, and FZ300 models.

The AF system will allow the mirrorless camera to focus in only 0.07 seconds while the upcoming Lumix GX80 will have a built-in electronic viewfinder and a tilting display, which consists of a 3-inch 1.04-million-dot LCD unit. Users of the camera will also enjoy 22 creative filters along with a monochrome mode.

The upcoming Panasonic GX85 will retain many of the features found in the GX8. When it comes to the price the GX85 model should be much cheaper than the GX8 which is currently selling for **$1,199.99**.

Along with the Lumix GX85 camera next week, Panasonic will most likely introduce the rumored Leica 12mm wide-angle lens for Micro Four Thirds cameras. There is also the Lumix LX200 premium compact model but there is not yet information about the official announcement.

Stay tuned for more information!
