Canon released a new firmware update for the [RF 35mm f/1.8 IS STM Macro][1] lens. The compact and lightweight prime lens is a great performer that pairs perfectly with the [EOS R full frame mirrorless system][2].

The RF 35mm F1.8 MACRO IS STM is a great wide-angle lens for portraiture and street photography, capturing detail and sharpness even at low shutter speeds. A fast f/1.8 maximum aperture lets you shoot authentic ambience, even when light levels are low.

## Firmware: Canon RF 35mm f/1.8 IS STM Macro v2.0.0

Firmware Version 2.0.0 incorporates the following enhancement:

  * Support for the “panning” scene mode with the EOS RP has been added. The “panning” scene mode reduces subject blurring and blurs the background when the lens is mounted to the EOS RP.

This firmware update is for lenses equipped with firmware version older than 2.0.0. If the lens firmware is already Version 2.0.0, it is not necessary to update the firmware.

The version of the lens firmware can be checked on the camera menu.
