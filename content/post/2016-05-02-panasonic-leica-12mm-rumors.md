**Panasonic Leica 12mm** lens is rumored to be in development which will be released sometime in the second half of 2016.

The new Leica-branded wide-angle optic with a focal length of 12mm will deliver a full-frame equivalent of 24mm and the maximum aperture is currently unknown.

Trusted sources are reporting that the Panasonic Leica 12mm prime lens is scheduled to be released during the second half of 2016.

As we are approaching the _Photokina 2016_, the worlds biggest digital imaging event in September. Panasonic will likely reveal the new 12mm optic with Leica name on it. We might see the announcement of this lens around the Photokina show. The wide-angle optic should become available in the market sometime in the **second half of 2016**.<!--more-->

This would be a good addition to their lineup but [Micro Four Thirds][1] users also demand for more wide-angle options like the 8mm and 10mm focal lengths. If this lens shows quality as good as the 15mm f/1.7 model than it will be very useful for MFT users.

Users are expecting a lot of new products after the Consumer Electronics Show and CP+ Events. For more products they have to wait for **Photokina** show this year. It will open its doors in September  for almost two weeks. So many camera and lens manufacturer are waiting for this biggest event as they show their important products only for this event.

The only announcement we may expect is the M.Zuiko 25mm f/1.2 PRO prime optic from Olympus. It will deliver a 35mm equivalent of 50mm. The company is rumored to hold its announcement event sometime by the end of May 2016.

Panasonic currently has the Leica-branded 25mm f/1.4 and the 15mm f/1.7 lenses for Micro Four Thirds cameras. The 12mm version is expected to become available this year, <a href="http://www.dailycameranews.com/2016/05/panasonic-12mm-lens-rumors/" rel="external">sources says</a>. Anyway stay tuned with Mirrorless Times for more information as we’ll update you with more news.
