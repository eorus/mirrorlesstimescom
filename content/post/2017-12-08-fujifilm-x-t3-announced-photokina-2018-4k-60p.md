Along with the upcoming [Fujifilm X-H1][1] in early 2018, Fujifilm is on the verge to announce a new X-mount mirrorless camera named <a href="https://www.mirrorlesstimes.com/tags/fujifilm-x-t3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Fujifilm X-T3</a>. Fujifilm X-T3 is rumored to be announced at Photokina 2018 in September.

This is good news for all the photographers waiting for Fuji to launch a <a href="https://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/Qv35CvewFbN3TtHd2ZaXJvgAAAFgNh8WHAEAAAFKARuC3u0/https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/http://www.amazon.com/Fujifilm-X-T2-Mirrorless-Digital-Body/dp/B01I3LNMAM/ref=as_at/?imprToken=HBPj--GtRZZb29DR.WnB-Q&slotNum=0&ie=UTF8&qid=1512545167&sr=8-4&keywords=fujifilm+x-t2&linkCode=sl1&tag=daicamnew-20&linkId=b715be5c053d73f906e6cad97d3cfe57" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">X-T2 successor</a>. The Fuji X-T3 will have a brand new image sensor, and the max framerate will be 4k 60p in terms of video recording.

The in-body image stabilization system IBIS will first appear on the X-H1 but it will only be capable of recording 4K videos at 30p.<!--more-->

## Fujifilm X-T3 to be Announced at Photokina 2018

Fujifilm is rumored to introduce the **Fujifilm X-T3 **sometime before _Photokina _2018, as the weather-sealed mirrorless camera will allegedly be present at world’s largest digital imaging event.

There are no detailed specifications leaked yet. The sources are claiming that a new and improved sensor is on the way for X-T3 and looks like it will still be the flagship of the weather sealed models in the X-series lineup. We say this because of the max framerate capabilities.

So what about the X-T3 release date. Expect the announcement prior to [Photokina 2018][3] in September, official announcement should be in late Summer makes sense.

Take it with a grain of salt and stay tuned with more [**Fujifilm Mirrorless**][4] news and <a href="https://www.dailycameranews.com/tag/fujifilm-rumors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fujifilm Rumors</a>.
