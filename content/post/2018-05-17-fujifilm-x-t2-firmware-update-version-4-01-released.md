<a href="https://www.mirrorlesstimes.com/category/fujifilm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fujifilm</a> today released the new firmware update version 4.01 for <a class="ext-link" title="" href="https://www.amazon.com/Fujifilm-X-T2-Mirrorless-Digital-Body/dp/B01I3LNMAM/?tag=mirrorlesst-20" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener" data-amzn-asin="B01I3LNMAM">Fujifilm X-T2</a> mirrorless camera.

The company has found some malfunctions in the firmware ver.4.00 released on May 8 2018. As a temporary solution for customers who have upgraded the firmware to ver.4.00, Fuji prepared a new firmware version of 4.01 whose functions are same as the ver.3.00.

This is basically a rollback firmware which reverts the X-T2 camera to the bug free firmare ver.3.00. See the details and download link of the Fujifilm X-T2 Firmware Update Version 4.01 below. <!--more-->

## Regarding the Malfunction of the FUJIFILM X-T2

To all loyal Fujifilm X Series customers and photographers,

It has been brought to our attention that there are a few issues with the recently released X-T2 ver 4.00 firmware update. We have therefore taken the difficult decision to remove the update from the website until we are confident that all the issues have been completely fixed.

We deeply apologize for any inconvenience and disappointment this has caused.

<div class="summaryBlockB01">
  <p>
    <strong><Details of the Problem></strong>
  </p>
</div>

We have discovered malfunctions in the firmware ver.4.00 released on May 8 2018. They are as follows:

<ol class="orderedListB01">
  <li>
    <em>When RAW files, which were taken by X-T2 (before firmware ver.4.00), are converted in camera (ver.4.00) or by “FUJIFILM X RAW STUDIO”, they are not converted properly.</em>
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>When pressing the shutter button halfway under certain conditions, the live view can flicker.</em>
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>In rare cases, a hang-up can occur.</em>
  </li>
</ol>

We have identified the cause and plan to release the upgraded firmware to address the malfunctions as soon as we can.

In the meantime, for customers who have upgraded the firmware to ver.4.00, the firmware ver.4.01<span class="note">*</span>, whose functions are same as ver.3.00, have been posted on our website.  
Please download it and update your camera.

<ul class="noteListB01">
  <li>
    <span class="pointer">*</span> Ver.4.01 doesn’t include the additional functions of ver.4.00.
  </li>
</ul>

Again, we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused.

We announced the firmware update for GFX 50S, X-H1 and X-Pro2, which was planned in May 2018, on the Global website on 12 Apr 2018. However, it will be postponed because we need more time to check the firmware for the three models. For detail, we will inform you later.
