The _Panasonic GX9_ is a premium rangefinder-style camera with Micro Four Thirds image sensor. It comes with a sleek design aimed at street photographers. Everything you need to know about the Panasonic _Lumix GX9_, including impressions and analysis, photos, video, release date, prices, specs.

The GX9 incorporates the same 20MP Micro Four Thirds sensor as its predecessor, but omits the low-pass filter found on previous models. The GX9 does not offer weather-sealing, unlike the GX8 and G9.

The price of the GX9 has come down to <a href="https://aax-us-east.amazon-adsystem.com/x/c/Qn-H1fVLK5eKMlrNUxF3IUUAAAFhmK3z2QEAAAFKAW2AisA/https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/http://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Mirrorless-Camera-Megapixel-DC-GX9MK/dp/B079QZ1Z1R/ref=as_at/?imprToken=TQwGarHKBXbaa58GQ05W-A&slotNum=0&ie=UTF8&qid=1518535629&sr=8-2&keywords=panasonic+gx9&linkCode=sl1&tag=daicamnew-20&linkId=7b943bb2b77b6e4effa9023454926157" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$999</a> with a kit lens.

_Panasonic&#8217;s_ compact Micro 4/3rds street and travel shooter gets a solid upgrade with a 20-megapixel, low-pass filter-free sensor. The Panasonic GX9 specs also includes dual in-lens/in-<wbr />body stabilization, tilting EVF and screen, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and creative shooting modes &#8211; in a smaller and nicer-looking body than ever.

The most notable changes include the removal of the low-pass filter on the GX9’s 20MP sensor, 5-axis in-body image stabilization (up from 4-axis), slightly faster burst shooting and **Bluetooth** connectivity.
