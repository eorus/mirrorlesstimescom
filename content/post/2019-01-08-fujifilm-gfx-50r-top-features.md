  * Sequential writing to the card slots will write everything to the first card until full and then the second
  * Backup writing will write a copy of your photos to each card slot
  * RAW/JPEG will write your RAW files to the first slot and JPEG to the second slot
  * If you play an image back and want to delete it the only way to have it removed from the first and second slot is to hit menu after play and then turn on simultaneously delete.
  * Bluetooth allows the wifi connection to work better.
  * Connecting your camera is easy using a QR code and the Fujifilm App

  * You can use your phone as remote control for the camera and it uses Bluetooth
  * You can focus bracket to capture a sharp image from the foreground to the background when the depth of field is not sharp.
  * Landscapes should consist of a 20 image capture, but macro probably 100 to get a sharp image with focus bracketing
  * With focus bracketing, you probably want to set it for 5 steps for landscape and 10 for macro
  * You can also delay each focus bracketing shot
  * Focus bracketing should start with the closest subject.
  * There are a lot of lens adapters for the GFX now and you can use a 35mm crop mode if you use full frame glass without a big enough image circle that is under the shooting menu.
