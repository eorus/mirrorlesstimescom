Each lens also features a surface treatment that enhances strength, a durable brass bayonet mount, and rubber sealing at the mount (for dust- and splash-proofing).

### Adapter

In addition to the 11 prime lenses, Sigma announced a new MC-21 mount converter for using <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/search?N=0&Ntt=Sigma+SA-mount+lenses&ci=15492&cp=15293%2B15492&BI=20175&KBID=14249" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sigma SA-mount</a> and <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/search?N=0&Ntt=+Sigma+EF-mount+lenses&ci=15492&cp=15293%2B15492&BI=20175&KBID=14249" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sigma EF-mount lenses</a> on L-mount mirrorless cameras such as <a href="https://www.mirrorlesstimes.com/tag/panasonic-s1/" data-wpel-link="internal">Panasonic’s new S1R and S1</a>.

“The expansion of the beloved Sigma prime lens line along with the MC-21 converter will increase the extensibility of the L-Mount system and further Sigma’s role in the strategic L-Mount Alliance alongside Leica and Panasonic,” Sigma says.

The converter allows more freedom of choice for L-Mount cameras from SIGMA, Leica Camera and Panasonic, enhancing the extensibility of the L-Mount system. The adapter will allow a total of 29 Sigma lenses to be used on the L-Mount.
