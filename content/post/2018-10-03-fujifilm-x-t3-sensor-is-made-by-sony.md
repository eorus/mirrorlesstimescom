## 26MP Fujifilm X-T3 Sensor is Made by Sony

The **26.1-megapixel, X-Trans CMOS IV** sensor on the Fuji X-T3 features a backside-illuminated design, a first for the X-mount lineup. The X-T3’s new sensor also comes with faster readout speeds, significantly reduces rolling shutter distortion.

From the interview:

> Definitely not a Samsung sensor. It’s the same manufacturing process that we have gone through with all our other X-Trans sensors. Still designed and tested all by our R&D team.
