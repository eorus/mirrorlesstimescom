Fujifilm is allegedly working on a new X100T successor camera. It is rumored to be named as **Fujifilm X100F**.

The X100 series will gain another member soon. A lot of peopled speculated that the Japanese company will launch a successor at Photokina 2016. There is a not much chance that this will be happening, but, Fuji lovers can wait for the early 2017 for good surprises.

Fujifilm X100T is the top X-series compact camera announced back in 2015. Now the successor model is in the talks as the new camera will not be named [Fujifilm X200][1] as previously rumored. It will be called **Fujifilm X100F.**

## Fujifilm X100F to be announced in 2017

According to recent <a href="http://www.fujirumors.com/fujifilm-x100t-successor-will-called-fujifilm-x100f/" target="_blank">rumors</a> the name will be **Fujifilm X100F**. The premium compact camera will have an APS-C-sized image sensor.  The “**F**” designation in the name is speculating to be the fourth model in the series.

The current Fujifilm X100 line consists of three models. The <a href="http://amzn.to/2csTjX8" target="_blank">X100</a>, <a href="http://amzn.to/2bE7Xd4" target="_blank">X100S</a> and <a href="http://amzn.to/2bVjJA8" target="_blank">X100T</a> features the same Fujinon 23mm F2 fixed lens.

An earlier rumor said that the Fujifilm X100T replacement will feature a wider lens. However, this information is likely false because a highly-reliable insider is claiming that the device will have a 23mm lens, which will offer a full-frame equivalent of approximately 35mm.

The successor of the X100T was rumored to be announced at Photokina 2016. Fuji had to deal with a shortage of X-Trans III sensor because of Kumamoto earthquake in Japan. So they decided to first focus on the [Fujifilm X-T2][2].

### Rumored Specifications

Now let’s have a look at the combined specs leaked so far. Both for X200 and X100F.

  * 24MP sensor of the X-Pro2
  * A new bright 23mm (35mm equiv.) lens
