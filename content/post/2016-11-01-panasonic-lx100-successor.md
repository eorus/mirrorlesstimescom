We get more information about the **Panasonic LX100 successor **camera that is expected to arrive in three months period.

Like all of you were expecting and we were ready to meet the Panasonic LX200 premium compact camera. The announcement is [rumored to happen][1] at Photokina 2016 event.

The LX100 hit the markets back in late 2014 to compete against the Sony RX100 and Canon PowerShot G7 X series digital compact models. The biggest reason behind the delay of the LX100 successor model is the absence of a perfect rival model.<!--more-->

## Panasonic LX100 successor coming in early 2017

Yes you can think about the **Canon G1X Mark III** and [Fuji X100F][2] models. These are fixed lens premium digital compact cameras in the industry. We think that Panasonic has decided to wait a little to see how the market reacts.

The <a href="http://www.dailycameranews.com/2014/09/panasonic-lx100/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Panasonic LX100</a> features a 4/3-inch 16MP High Sensitivity MOS sensor. The processor offers a 4K video recording at 30p speed and high speed burst shooting at 11 fps. The specs list also include a 24-75mm F1.7-F2.8 Leica lens, Live View Finder (LVF) with 2764K-dot equivalent high resolution.

The image sensor of the upcoming Panasonic LX100 successor camera would be the same as in Micro Four Thirds format. If so we may expect the same 20MP one found on the GX8 model. On the other hand it might be a 1-inch-type sensor, like the one found in the RX100 and G7 X cameras. This might depend to the Canon&#8217;s move on the G1 X Mark III sensor if it will be APS-c or 1&#8243;-type.

The price should stand around $900 mark just like the LX100 was released in November 2014. Here are the rumored Panasonic Lx100 successor specs posted so far.

### Possible Panasonic LX200 Specs

  * 20-Megapixel Live MOS sensor (made by Sony)
  * DFD AF technology that will increase the AF speed to 0.07 seconds
  * Larger OLED viewfinder
  * Tiltable screen similar to the GX8
  * Built-in ND filter
  * ISO up to 51,200
  * New filter effects
  * Built-in flash

There is no information about the official announcement date of the **Panasonic LX100 successor** camera. The premium compact shooter probably be unveiled in early 2017. We can expect the CES 2017 or CP+2017 events.
