**Olympus 30mm macro** lens is rumored to be in development which will be released sometime in the second half of 2016.

The new prime optic with macro capabilities will deliver a full-frame equivalent of 60mm and the maximum aperture is currently unknown. If the aperture seems to be fast than this lens might compete against the Sigma 30mm f/1.4 prime model.

As we are approaching the _Photokina 2016_, the worlds biggest digital imaging event in September. Olympus 30mm macro lens will likely be unveiled during or around the Photokina show. The macro lens for Micro Four Thirds system should become available in the market sometime in the second half of 2016.<!--more-->

## Olympus 30mm macro lens to be announced in 2016

This would be a good addition to their lineup but [Micro Four Thirds][1] users also demand for more all-in-one prime models. a So featuring a maximum aperture of f/2 would also make this as a fast long standard lens and macro. That sure would be more useful for MFT users.

Users are expecting a lot of new products after the Consumer Electronics Show and CP+ Events. For more products they have to wait for Photokina show this year. It will open its doors in September for almost two weeks. So, many camera and lens manufacturers are waiting for this biggest event as they show their important products only for this event.

We may expect the long-rumored [E-M1 Mark II][2] camera and [M.Zuiko 25mm f/1.2 PRO][3] prime optic from Olympus. The lens will deliver a 35mm equivalent of 50mm. The company is rumored to hold its announcement event sometime by the end of May 2016 or for Summer.

If the <a href="http://www.43rumors.com/ft4-olympus-will-announce-a-new-30mm-macro-lens/" target="_blank" rel="external nofollow">rumored</a> **Olympus 30mm macro** lens becomes available in the market then it will be the second macro model after the 60mm f/2.8. The optic will be compatible with Micro Four Thirds system cameras.
