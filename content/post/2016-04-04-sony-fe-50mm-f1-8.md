It features an internal design consisting of six elements in five groups with one aspherical glass element. The 7-blade circular diaphragm will deliver amazing bokeh effects and a shallow depth of field when choosing a fast aperture for low-light and indoor photography.

The lens comes with a metal mount and weighs only 186 grams / 0.41 lbs. Metal bayonet offers increased durability and a solid feel when mounting the lens.

As for its dimensions, the Sony FE 50mm f/1.8 lens measures 69mm / 2.72 inches in diameter, 60mm / 2.36 inches in lengths, and has a filter thread of 49mm.

Sony E-mount mirrorless camera users can use the lens with APS-C-sized image sensor models like the A6000-series. If so, it will offer a 35mm focal length equivalent of approximately 75mm.
