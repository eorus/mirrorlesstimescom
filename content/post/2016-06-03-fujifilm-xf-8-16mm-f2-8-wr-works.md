Fujifilm is allegedly working on a new wide-angle zoom lens and it will be the new Fujinon **XF 8-16mm f/2.8 WR** lens.

Fuji is a busy company this year as they are expanding X-mount lens line-up seriously. The optic in mention is a new wide-angle zoom that will be weather sealed. It will have a focal range between 8-16mm for APS-c sized sensors which corresponds to 12-24mm in 35mm full-frame equivalent.

As a result a new Fujinon **XF 8-16mm f/2.8 WR** lens rumored to be in the works but it is not expected to become official soon. <!--more-->

## Fujifilm XF 8-16mm f/2.8 WR lens is in development?

We may not see this product at Photokina 2016. When it comes to the announcement date there are speculations about early 2017. If the company confirms its development in late 2016 we can expect the **XF 8-16mm f/2.8 WR** lens to become available sometime in 2017, <a title="Fujifilm will develop an XF 8-16mmF2.8 WR lens" href="http://www.fujirumors.com/fujifilm-will-develop-a-xf-8-16mmf2-8-wr-lens-srp-with-poll/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">sources</a> say.

Fujifilm XF 8-16mm f/2.8 WR lens will be a perfect choice for landscape photography. It is good to see a WR designation on the product which means that it will be weathersealed. Good news and combination alternative for the current X-T1 or the [upcoming X-T2][1] mirrorless camera users.

### Fujifilm XF 50mm f/2 R prime is in development too

When considering the demand for more lenses from X-mount mirrorless camera users, the X-series users already has the XF 35mm f/2 R WR, while the [XF 23mm f/2 R][2] is coming at Photokina 2016. Nevertheless, another f/2 prime is being worked on, one with a 50mm focal length.

The XF 50mm f/2 R prime lens announcement date is a long way till 2017. It is believed the product is in the early stages of development.

Alongside the wide-angle prime optic, the company is rumored to announce several new products including the [XF 33mm f/1.0][3] and <a href="http://www.dailycameranews.com/2016/02/fujifilm-xf-200mm-f2-lens-rumored-to-be-in-development/" target="_blank">XF 200mm f/2</a> lenses as well as the highly anticipated [Fujifilm X200][4] digital compact camera for Photokina 2016.

So as a wrap up, both the **XF 8-16mm f/2.8 WR** and the **XF 50mm f/2** R lenses to become available sometime in 2017. Stay tuned for more information.
